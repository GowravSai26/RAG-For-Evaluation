Part of our Board's responsibilities are to hold our Group D&I Council to account for defining and implementing our global D&I strategy. Our Group D&I Council is chaired by Laura Mason, CEO, Private Markets and a member of our Group Management Committee. For us D&I goes beyond the traditional focus on “protected characteristics” such as age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and gender identity. While these are very important indicators of what an individual’s perspective might be, we also think that every individual has unique circumstances and our Group D&I Council is accountable for understanding our employees perspectives as well as shaping our D&I agenda. To drive the delivery of our D&I agenda, our Group Head of Inclusion, Group Inclusion Partners and HR teams (Talent Acquisition, Engagement, Policy, Learning ﹠ Development) each play a part in implementing L&G's strategy. Each of our divisional CEOs (and members of our Group Executive Committee) have a proportion of their bonus awarded based on culture. Our annual ""Culture Review"" process is an in-depth assessment of the levels of inclusion across our business, where we look at diversity data, employee feedback and progress made against our stated D&I goals. Lastly, we have an active and engaged global employee network specifically for LGBTQ+ people and allies - Our ""L&GBT+Allies"" network.

3. **Group Head of Inclusion, Group Inclusion Partners, and HR Teams**

Our Group Execs each have 10% of their variable bonus attributed to their performance creating an inclusive culture. Our annual Culture Review process is undertaken as a bottom-up and top-down review of progress around culture, including on our aims to create a diverse workforce and inclusive workplace. - Our group and divisional D&I teams are targeted to deliver against their respective D&I plans as part of our regular performance review process. - As well as the regular performance review process, Line Managers are also assessed using colleague feedback from their teams. The data is captured using our ""Voice"" employee surveys (every 6months). We ask colleagues to provide feedback against a number of issues including inclusion, connection / belonging, speaking out and purposeful leadership. It's also worth acknowledging our view on targets. We want to see regular, progressive improvements in the diversity of our workforce. We won’t be setting outcome targets; instead we track progress against a baselines. This is for a number of reasons: - we recognise that our work to increase the diversity of our workforce and the inclusion of our workplace will never be done - it's a journey of continuous improvement. - It’s also because we have a diverse business. Hove, Cardiff, Chicago, Hong Kong, Singapore and London are very different places, and success will look slightly different for every business we run and every geography we operate in. - We also know that data about our employees is critical if we’re to understand the progress we’re making against our vision: we’ll only know how successful we’ve been when we understand the scale of the challenge we face. - What doesn’t change is our overall vision of a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace.

We promote the events organised by our L&GBT+Allies Network across the group with the support of senior execs and have taken steps in 2024 to focus on the Allyship aspects of the network (e.g. our Allyship Unmasked: Inspiring Stories of Support event in May 2024 held in conjunction with LGBT Great and chaired by Michael Marks, the network’s senior sponsor). Other networks are also keen to partner up with L&GBT in organising family/parenting events (Family and Carers Network) and LGBT+ mental health events (Health&Wellbeing) and also recognise the challenges faced by LGBT+ individuals across the world (Culture Club). All employees have a Culture/D﹠I objective which is measured as part of the annual review process, additionally colleagues who support the LGBT agenda are recognised through the Chairman's awards, opportunities to attend LGBT+ awards, partake in mentoring and leadership development, educational and social events organised by the LGBT committee and funded by the business.",,"Your organisation recognises and rewards employees supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I through multiple sustained efforts, including:

1. **Executive Accountability & Sponsorship**  
   - **Executive Sponsor:** Laura Mason  
   - **Role:**  
     - Serves as the **Executive Sponsor for Diversity & Inclusion**.

2. **Governance Structure**  
   - **Group D&I Council:**  
     - **Chair:** Laura Mason.  
     - **Meeting Frequency:** Bi-monthly.  
     - **Function:**  
       - Acts as the central governance body overseeing the development, implementation, and monitoring of the Group-wide D&I strategy.  
       - Ensures that D&I initiatives address a range of **protected characteristics**, which would typically encompass sexual orientation and gender reassignment/identity, and therefore cover LGBTQ+ inclusion.  
   - **Integration into Corporate Governance:**  
     - The Group D&I Council is **formally embedded within L&G’s Group Corporate Governance structure**, ensuring that D&I (including LGBTQ+ matters) is treated as a core governance and risk/strategy issue, not a standalone or informal initiative.

   - **Reporting Line:**  
     - The D&I Council **reports annually** on progress to the **Group Board**.

     - Progress against the **Group-wide D&I strategy**, including outcomes and initiatives relating to protected characteristics.  
     - This structure provides formal accountability for **LGBTQ+ inclusion outcomes** at Board level.

4. **Scope of the D&I Strategy (Including LGBTQ+ Focus)**  
   - The **Group-wide D&I strategy** is explicitly described as being **inclusive of a range of “protected characteristics.”**

Below is the list of each policy referenced along with supporting commentary. As requested, please find the attached copies of these policies for your review.

**1. Diversity and Inclusion Policy**  
*Supporting Commentary:*  
This policy sets out Legal & General Group’s commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace environment that respects and values diversity. It specifically addresses protections and support regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression—including transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming employees—to ensure equity and inclusion across all levels of the organization.

**2. Dignity at Work Policy**  
*Supporting Commentary:*  
The Dignity at Work Policy is designed to prevent bullying, harassment, and stalking within the workplace. It aims to create a safe work environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect regardless of characteristics such as sexual orientation or gender identity. This policy ensures clear procedures are in place to address any incidents of inappropriate behavior promptly and effectively.

**3. Family Leave Policy**  
*Supporting Commentary:*  
This policy outlines provisions for adoption leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, and shared parental leave, ensuring these benefits are accessible to all employees. The policy explicitly confirms that leave entitlements apply irrespective of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, promoting fairness in family-related rights and responsibilities.

If you need help formatting this for a survey or further assistance, please let me know!",100%,"### LGBTQ+ DE&I Data Collection – Summary of Responsibilities

Based on the employee’s response, the organization appears to collect voluntary information on sexual orientation as part of its DE&I efforts. The following key elements and responsibilities can be inferred:

#### 1. Scope of Information Collected
The organization asks employees:

> “What best describes your sexual orientation?”

This framing emphasizes self-identification and allows individuals to choose the description that fits them best.

#### 2. Available Response Options
Employees are offered a structured set of options:

- **Bisexual**  
- **Gay Man**  
- **Gay Woman / Lesbian**  
- **Heterosexual / Straight**  
- **I identify in another way** – with a **free-text option** for self-description  
- **Prefer not to say**

This combination of fixed options and free-text supports both clarity in data collection and respect for individual identity.

#### 3. Inclusion and Respect for Diversity
- The list explicitly includes several commonly recognized sexual orientations (bisexual, gay man, gay woman/lesbian, heterosexual/straight).  
- The **“I identify in another way”** option, with open text, ensures inclusivity for identities that are:
  - Non‑binary in terms of sexual orientation categories
  - Less commonly represented in standard lists
  - Personally nuanced or fluid

This design reflects a responsibility to acknowledge the diversity of LGBTQ+ identities beyond traditional labels.

#### 4. Privacy and Autonomy
- The **“Prefer not to say”** option is critical for:
  - Respecting employee privacy
  - Ensuring participation is voluntary
  - Mitigating pressure to disclose sensitive personal information

By including this option, the organization shows responsibility for data protection and personal autonomy in sensitive DE&I data collection.

#### 5. DE&I Governance Implications
From an ESG and DE&I standpoint, this practice suggests:

- **Monitoring and Measurement**: The organization is gathering sexual orientation data to understand representation and potential disparities affecting LGBTQ+ employees.
- **Potential Use in Policy and Programming**: Such data can inform:
  - Targeted inclusion initiatives for LGBTQ+ staff
  - Tailored benefits, resource groups, or support services
  - Assessments of fairness in recruitment, promotion, and retention

To align with best practice, this approach should be accompanied by:
- Clear communication on **how and why** the data is collected and used  
- Strong **confidentiality** and **data protection** measures  
- Regular review of categories to reflect evolving language and community feedback

---

## 1. Integration of Self‑ID into Employee Lifecycle

### 1.1 Onboarding Process  
- **Prompted Data Review for New Joiners**  
  - New employees receive specific prompts during onboarding to review and confirm the accuracy of their personal and self‑ID information.  
  - This normalises the practice of sharing DE&I data from the start of employment and positions it as a standard, supported process rather than an exceptional or risky action.

### 1.2 Continuous Data Accuracy  
- By embedding prompts in onboarding, the organisation signals that self‑ID data is important, regularly maintained, and treated as an integral part of HR data management and inclusion practices.

---

## 2. Education & Culture-Building Around Inclusion

### 2.1 Mandatory / Auto-Enrolled Inclusion Learning  
- **Hive Intro to Inclusion Learning**  
  - All new joiners are automatically enrolled in an “Intro to Inclusion” learning module.  
  - This training supports psychological safety by:
    - Building baseline awareness of DE&I concepts, including LGBTQ+ inclusion.
    - Helping employees understand why self‑ID data is collected and how it relates to equity and inclusion.
    - Indirectly reassuring employees that diverse identities are recognised and valued.

### 2.2 Signalling Organisational Commitment  
- Auto-enrolment suggests that inclusion is considered a core competency and organisational priority, not an optional extra, which can increase trust in how self‑ID data will be used and protected.

---

## 3. Campaigns to Encourage Voluntary Disclosure

### 3.1 Annual “Count Me In” Campaign  
- **Regular, Business-Wide Communication**  
  - The organisation runs an annual campaign titled “Count Me In” to specifically encourage employees to share or update their DE&I self‑ID data.  
  - Communications are sent across the business explaining:
    - The importance of sharing DE&I data (e.g., for monitoring representation, identifying gaps, shaping policies and benefits).
    - How to update information and where to do it.

### 3.2 Reinforcing Voluntary and Informed Participation  
- The campaign’s recurring nature helps:
  - Remind employees that they can update their information as identities or comfort levels evolve.
  - Encourage those who did not feel comfortable at joining or previously to participate when they feel safer.
  - Move towards more complete and accurate representation data while emphasising that disclosure is voluntary.

---

## 4. Evolution of Systems to Better Reflect Gender Identity

### 4.1 HRMS (HR Management System) Updates  
- **Expanded and More Inclusive Options**  
  - The organisation has recently updated the gender identity options in its HRMS.  
  - These changes aim to:
    - Better reflect the diversity of gender identities beyond a binary framework.
    - Give employees options that more accurately match their identity, which is especially important for trans, non‑binary and gender non‑conforming employees.

### 4.2 Reducing Misrepresentation and Erasure  
- By providing more granular and inclusive categories, the organisation:
  - Reduces the need for employees to misclassify themselves or opt out because their identity is not represented.
  - Demonstrates sensitivity to contemporary understandings of gender identity, contributing to a more inclusive data environment and better LGBTQ+ representation in metrics.

---

## 5. Overall Assessment of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility

Based on the actions described, the organisation demonstrates the following responsibilities and practices relevant to LGBTQ+ DE&I and self‑ID data:

1. **Proactive Inclusion in Core Processes**  
   - Embeds self‑ID prompts and inclusion training into standard onboarding steps, indicating structural commitment rather than one-off initiatives.

2. **Ongoing Engagement and Communication**  
   - Uses an annual, named campaign (“Count Me In”) to normalise updating DE&I data and to maintain awareness over time.

3. **Systemic Support for LGBTQ+ Identities**  
   - Updates HR systems to reflect a broader spectrum of gender identities, reducing structural barriers to self‑identification.

4. **Creating Conditions for Psychological Safety**  
   - By combining education, inclusive systems, and regular communication, the organisation is working to foster an environment where employees are more likely to feel comfortable disclosing LGBTQ+ and other DE&I-related aspects of their identity.

Further enhancement could include explicit communication about data privacy and usage, visible endorsement from leadership, and involvement of LGBTQ+ employee resource groups in designing and reviewing self‑ID options and campaigns.",100%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,"L&G careers website: Our new careers website includes employee testimonials and story telling from our colleagues, including those from the LGBT+ community.

1. **Inclusive Employer Branding & Messaging**  
   - The organisation’s careers site is built around a clear, overarching inclusion statement:  
     *“At L&G, we stand for inclusion… A workplace where differences breed originality, and you can be at your best no matter who you are.”*  
   - Language on the site is deliberately broad and identity-affirming, emphasising empowerment of all employees, “no matter who you are,” which explicitly includes LGBTQ+ colleagues.

2. **Visible LGBTQ+ Representation in Recruitment Materials**  
   - The careers website uses **imagery and video** that visibly features LGBTQ+ employees, for example in the “Diversity and Inclusion at Legal & General” video.  
   - This visual representation signals to potential LGBTQ+ candidates that they are recognised and welcome, and that diversity is not just policy but part of the organisation’s everyday culture.

3. **Storytelling and Role Models from the LGBTQ+ Community**  
   - The organisation highlights **employee testimonials and personal stories** from LGBTQ+ staff on its careers platforms and LinkedIn.  
   - These stories (e.g., Pride Month reflections and pieces on active allyship) showcase real experiences, career journeys, and inclusive practices, helping LGBTQ+ candidates see themselves reflected in the workforce and leadership pipeline.

4. **Leadership Commitment and Public Signalling**  
   - The CEO publishes public statements supporting Pride and LGBTQ+ inclusion, reinforcing that LGBTQ+ equality is backed at the highest level.  
   - This visible leadership advocacy is a key DE&I responsibility: it legitimises internal initiatives and signals to external LGBTQ+ talent that inclusion is a strategic and cultural priority, not a niche HR topic.

5. **Integration of LGBTQ+ Inclusion into Overall Culture Narrative**  
   - LGBTQ+ inclusion is not treated as a standalone or token initiative; it is integrated into the broader **“Diversity and Inclusion at L&G”** narrative and overall employer value proposition.

- The Executive Sponsor and I&D-led Chair operationalise the strategy and champion initiatives.
- HR/People and Comms functions embed and communicate LGBTQ+ inclusion in systems and culture.
- Staff participants ensure that initiatives are grounded in lived experience and have broad organisational reach.",70%,35cc2d603789460ca6a7860e603cf021,"For each of the selected stakeholder groups in Q3, please describe who they are and how they are measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and objectives.

2. Develop or adopt clear metrics specifically related to LGBTQ+ inclusion, such as representation percentages, employee engagement survey results, inclusion training completion rates, and feedback from LGBTQ+ employee resource groups.
3. Confirm and document permissions when referencing individuals by name in any reports or communications, to respect privacy and comply with data protection standards.

If you need assistance drafting these measurement criteria or guidance on stakeholder communication and consent processes, please let me know!",100%,"Below is a structured ESG-focused summary of the company’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and current practices based on the employee’s response.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Identification

The response implies that the organization has stakeholder groups (e.g., employees, management, possibly customers or regulators) but:

- It does **not** specify which stakeholder groups were selected in Q3.
- It does **not** describe who these stakeholders are in relation to LGBTQ+ DE&I (e.g., LGBTQ+ employees, allies, leadership, etc.).

At present, the organization’s approach to LGBTQ+ DE&I appears to be **organization‑wide** rather than tailored to clearly defined stakeholder segments.

---

## 2. Current State of LGBTQ+ DE&I Measurement

**Key point:**  
The organization **does not currently have any specific metrics or measurements** for LGBTQ+ DE&I.

This means:

- No defined KPIs specifically related to LGBTQ+ representation, inclusion, or experiences.
- No established tracking of LGBTQ+ outcomes by stakeholder group (e.g., employees vs. leadership vs. customers).
- No formal framework for monitoring progress against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals.

From an ESG perspective, this indicates an **early-stage** or **baseline** level of LGBTQ+ DE&I maturity, with intent to develop a more structured approach.

---

## 3. Planned Framework: Use of FCA/PRA Policy Statement on I&D

The organization states that it will use the **FCA/PRA Policy Statement on Diversity & Inclusion (I&D) in financial services** as a:

- **“Springboard”** to:  
  - Define LGBTQ+ and broader diversity and inclusion objectives.
  - Establish **how these objectives should be measured**.
- Reference point for:
  - Designing governance and accountability structures for DE&I.
  - Aligning internal practice with evolving regulatory expectations in the financial services sector.
  - Creating consistent, reportable metrics that can be applied across stakeholder groups.

This indicates a **forward‑looking commitment** to:

- Develop formal LGBTQ+ DE&I goals.
- Implement measurable indicators (e.g., representation, recruitment, promotion, retention, inclusion surveys, training coverage).
- Integrate LGBTQ+ DE&I into compliance and risk frameworks aligned with financial services regulation.

---

## 4. ESG Responsibility Implications

From an ESG and LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility standpoint, the response implies:

1. **Acknowledgment of a Gap**  
   - The organization recognizes it currently lacks specific LGBTQ+ metrics.
   - This is transparent but highlights an area of underdevelopment against best practice.

2. **Regulatory‑Aligned Intent**  
   - Use of FCA/PRA I&D policy suggests an intent to:
     - Embed LGBTQ+ and other DE&I considerations into **governance, risk management, and conduct**.
     - Potentially set **targets and reporting** obligations consistent with regulatory expectations.

3. **Next Steps for Robust Practice** (inferred)  
   Once metrics are defined, responsibilities may include:
   - **For Leadership/Board:** Oversight of LGBTQ+ DE&I strategy and regulatory alignment.
   - **For HR/People Functions:** Data collection, analysis, and policy implementation (e.g., inclusive benefits, transition policies, recruitment practices).
   - **For Line Managers:** Accountability for inclusive culture and equitable treatment of LGBTQ+ staff.
   - **For All Employees:** Adherence to anti-discrimination and inclusion standards.

However, these responsibilities are **not yet explicitly defined** in the response; they are anticipated outcomes of the planned framework.

---

## 5. Permission to Use Names

- The response **does not reference any specific individual by name**.
- Therefore, there is **no need for permission** for name usage, and no confirmation is applicable.

---

### Summary

The organization currently has **no specific LGBTQ+ DE&I metrics** in place and is at an early stage in formalizing its approach. It plans to use the **FCA/PRA Policy Statement on I&D in financial services** as the foundation to define LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and determine how to measure them across stakeholder groups, signaling an intention to move toward structured, regulatory‑aligned LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility and accountability.",70%,0e5cee8da6d243ed8d4c091a6d8bbff5,How does your organisation recognise and reward employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"Our financial reward framework is based on financial and non-financial objectives, performance against individual goals and against The Vanquis Way, our values - We care About People, We Pull Together as a Team, We Find A Better Way, We Get the Right Things Done. Additionally the internal reward and recognition system allows for all colleagues to be recognised for exemplary actions by each other. These are values awards and this can include internal points which can be converted into financial reward. This has been used to highlight employees who play a key part in driving the LGBTQ+ agenda.",,"Your response effectively outlines how your organisation recognises and rewards employees, linking the approach to both overall values and specific support for LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts. To enhance clarity and impact, you might consider explicitly stating the connection to LGBTQ+ DE&I recognition earlier and emphasizing how these rewards reinforce inclusion. Here's a revised version:

---

Our organisation’s financial reward framework integrates both financial and non-financial objectives, assessing performance against individual goals and our core values encapsulated in The Vanquis Way: We Care About People, We Pull Together as a Team, We Find A Better Way, and We Get the Right Things Done. Within this framework, we actively recognise employees who contribute meaningfully to supporting LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In addition, our internal reward and recognition system empowers all colleagues to acknowledge exemplary actions by their peers through values-based awards. These awards include internal points that can be converted into financial rewards. This system has been effectively used to highlight and celebrate employees who play key roles in advancing the LGBTQ+ agenda, thereby fostering a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture.

If you want, I can help tailor this further based on your audience or specific organisational examples.",100%,"**Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Recognition & Reward Practices**

1. **Integration into Core Performance & Reward Framework**  
   - The organisation’s financial reward framework is based on:  
     - Financial and non‑financial objectives  
     - Performance against individual goals  
     - Demonstrable alignment with the corporate values (“The Vanquis Way”):  
       - *We Care About People*  
       - *We Pull Together as a Team*  
       - *We Find a Better Way*  
       - *We Get the Right Things Done*  
   - Efforts that advance LGBTQ+ diversity, equity and inclusion can contribute to the “non‑financial objectives” and to evidence of living these values, and therefore can positively influence formal performance assessments and associated financial rewards.

2. **Peer‑to‑Peer Recognition and Values Awards**  
   - An internal reward and recognition system allows any colleague to recognise others for exemplary behaviour.  
   - Recognition is explicitly values‑based, meaning actions that support LGBTQ+ inclusion (e.g., advocacy, allyship, education, policy implementation, network leadership) can be highlighted as strong demonstrations of the organisation’s values.  
   - “Values awards” can include internal points that colleagues accumulate.

3. **Conversion into Tangible Financial Reward**  
   - Points earned through the recognition system can be converted into a financial reward.  
   - This creates a direct, tangible incentive for employees whose contributions to LGBTQ+ DE&I are visible and valued by peers and leaders.

4. **Specific Application to LGBTQ+ DE&I**  
   - The organisation notes that this framework has already been used to spotlight employees who are “key” in driving the LGBTQ+ agenda.  
   - This indicates that:  
     - LGBTQ+ DE&I work is not only informally praised but formally acknowledged.  
     - Such contributions can be tied to both reputational recognition (awards, visibility) and monetary benefit (converted points, impact on performance reviews).

**Overall ESG/DE&I Implication**  
The organisation embeds LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions within its mainstream performance, recognition and reward systems, rather than treating them as peripheral. Employees who actively support and advance LGBTQ+ inclusion can be recognised by peers, celebrated through values‑based awards, and receive financial benefits linked to those efforts.",100%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.",Our LGBTQ+ Affinity Group share and promote the events arranged and host by LGBT Great.

  - A duty to **center marginalized voices** during significant cultural observances.

### 4. Intersectional Allyship and Education
- On 24th June, the organization hosted an **Intersectional Allyship session** in partnership with **LGBT Great**.
- This indicates several DE&I responsibilities:
  - **Education & awareness-building**: Providing structured learning on how different aspects of identity (e.g., sexuality, ethnicity, migration status) intersect.
  - **Allyship development**: Helping non-LGBTQ+ employees understand how to be **effective allies**, especially in an intersectional context.
  - **Partnership with experts**: Working with an external specialist organization (LGBT Great) to ensure **credible, high-quality content** and best practices.

- The allyship session was **“well received”** and **“started the conversation”**, suggesting:
  - Employees are receptive to **LGBTQ+ and intersectionality topics**.
  - The organization is at a stage of **building or deepening the dialogue** rather than considering the work complete.
- Implicit responsibilities:
  - To **continue the conversation** beyond one-off events.
  - To translate awareness into **ongoing practices, policies, and behaviors** that support LGBTQ+ inclusion.

### 6. Internal Focus and Improvement Opportunities
- Activities so far are **primarily internal**:
  - Internal storytelling.
  - Internal education sessions.
- This internal focus reflects:
  - A current priority on **employee experience** and **internal culture change**.
- It also clearly indicates areas for further responsibility:
  - Considering **broader, more regular programming** beyond Pride month.
  - Potentially **sharing best practices or success stories externally** (e.g., in ESG reporting, careers pages, or community engagement) when appropriate and with consent.
  - Embedding **intersectional LGBTQ+ perspectives** in wider HR policies, leadership development, and performance expectations.

---

- Platforming intersectional LGBTQ+ voices and stories.  
- Supporting an LGBTQ+ affinity group.  
- Partnering with LGBT Great to deliver an intersectional allyship session.  
- Fostering internal dialogue and empathy about coming out, migration, and feeling supported at work.

**Purpose (Implied DE&I Responsibility)**  
- To understand the sexual-orientation diversity of the workforce.
- To inform DE&I strategies, policies, and support mechanisms for LGBTQ+ employees.

   - Signals awareness of identities often overlooked in standard HR categories.

2. **Heterosexual/Straight**  
   - Includes employees who are romantically/sexually attracted to different genders.

3. **Bisexual**  
   - Acknowledges attraction to more than one gender.
   - Supports bi visibility within the LGBTQ+ spectrum.

6. **Gay Man**  
   - Explicitly includes men attracted to men.
   - Maintains clarity of representation across gender lines.

7. **I prefer to self-describe (open text)**  
   - Allows employees to use their own terminology if existing options do not fit.
   - Supports nuanced and emerging identities (e.g., pansexual, demisexual, questioning, etc.).
   - Reflects a responsibility to accommodate evolving language and identity categories.

8. **I prefer not to say**  
   - Respects employee privacy and autonomy.
   - Aligns with best practice for voluntary demographic data collection.

## 3. DE&I Implications and Responsibilities

Based on this structure, the organization implicitly assumes several responsibilities:

1. **Voluntary Participation and Privacy**
   - Ensuring that all responses are optional, with no negative consequence for selecting “I prefer not to say.”
   - Protecting the confidentiality of individual responses (aggregate reporting, data safeguards).

2. **Inclusivity of Identities**
   - Recognizing multiple specific LGBTQ+ categories rather than a single “LGBTQ+” checkbox.
   - Providing a self-description field acknowledges that standard labels may not fit all employees.

3. **Non-Discrimination and Psychological Safety**
   - Using inclusive categories obliges the organization to:
     - Prevent discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation.
     - Foster an environment where employees feel safe to self-identify if they choose.

4. **Use of Data for DE&I Improvement**
   - The company should:
     - Use aggregated data to identify gaps (e.g., representation, promotion, engagement).
     - Shape or refine policies, benefits, and support structures for LGBTQ+ staff (e.g., inclusive benefits, ERGs, training).
     - Monitor equity outcomes for employees across different orientations.

5. **Ongoing Review of Language**
   - Commitment to periodically revisiting options and language to:
     - Reflect evolving terminology and community preferences.
     - Ensure that no group is inadvertently excluded or misrepresented.

Your data is stored and managed following strict GDPR guidelines and will never be used for any other purpose. 3 It’s not just about you We need to think big picture.

1. **Transparent Communication via Intranet**: You have created a dedicated intranet page that clearly explains to colleagues how their self-ID data is collected, used, and protected. This helps build trust through transparency.

2. **Providing Clear Motivations with “Five Reasons to Share Your Diversity Data”**: This approach articulates compelling reasons why sharing data matters, such as making a significant positive difference, security of data, contributing to the bigger picture, ease of sharing, and the optional nature of disclosure, encouraging participation without pressure.

3. **Emphasizing Data Security and Privacy**: You assure colleagues that their personal information is stored securely under strict GDPR guidelines, is only visible to limited super-users, and never used beyond the stated purposes, addressing privacy concerns.

4. **Highlighting the Impact of Data Sharing**: By underscoring how accurate data informs decision-making, tracks progress, and celebrates improvements, you show the practical benefits of participation.

5. **Simplicity and Accessibility**: Making the process quick and easy through a short online form accessible via the local HR portal encourages completion and allows updating responses anytime.

6. **Respect for Voluntary Disclosure**: Reinforcing that sharing data is optional and that “prefer not to answer” is an acceptable response respects individual comfort levels while encouraging as much participation as possible.

---

## 1. Inclusive and Bias-Reduced Job Advertising

**1.1 Use of Gender Decoder (Mandatory Step)**  
- All job adverts are run through a gender bias decoder tool prior to publication.  
- Objective: remove gendered or biased language that may deter applicants, including LGBTQ+ and gender-diverse candidates.  
- This is embedded as a required control within the recruitment process, indicating a systematic, not ad-hoc, approach.

**1.2 Equal Opportunities Statement in Adverts**  
Every job advert includes an explicit equal opportunities statement that:

- Emphasises an open, honest and fair workplace culture.  
- Clearly states a commitment to a positive, inclusive atmosphere based on respect for differences.  
- Lists protected characteristics explicitly, including:
  - Gender
  - Marital status
  - Sexual orientation
  - Race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, culture
  - Religion or belief
  - Age
  - Disability  
- Extends protection to “any other reason that cannot be reasonably justified,” signalling an intention to protect non-listed or emerging identities.  
- Affirms that everyone is to be:
  - Treated equally and fairly
  - Valued
  - Treated with dignity and respect

**1.3 Policy Framework Underpinning Inclusion**  
- Equality and Diversity Policy and related People Policies are referenced as the formal backbone of inclusive practices.  
- These policies are positioned as the mechanism through which:
  - Equality of opportunity is implemented,
  - Fair treatment is monitored,
  - Dignity and respect are codified and enforced.

- Gender balance  
- Social mobility  
- Disability  

Activities include:

  - How these groups experience the job search process
  - What they look for in potential employers and roles
- Using this feedback to refine:
  - Job adverts and messaging
  - Attraction strategies
  - Candidate experience approaches  

This demonstrates a feedback-driven, participatory approach to LGBTQ+ inclusion in recruitment.

---

## 3. Employer Branding and Authentic Representation

**3.1 Social Media Communication**  
- The organisation actively communicates on social channels that it is proud of colleagues being able to “be themselves in the workplace.”  
- This communicates:
  - A visible, public commitment to authenticity and inclusion for LGBTQ+ staff.
  - Signalling to LGBTQ+ candidates that the environment is accepting and supportive, not merely compliant.

## 4. Strategic Use of Recruitment Channels

**4.1 Continuous Review of Job Boards**  
- The organisation continuously reviews the job boards it uses:
  - To ensure they are appropriate for reaching a diverse talent pool.

## 5. Supplier and Agency Standards on Equality and Inclusion

**5.1 Preferred Supplier List (PSL) Equality Criteria**  
- Regular PSL reviews include an assessment of how recruitment suppliers:
  - Support equal opportunities in their own practices, policies, and procedures.

**Question Asked**  
1. *“Which of the following best describes your gender?”*

**Response Options**  
- Female  
- Male  
- Nonbinary  
- Prefer not to disclose  

**ESG / DE&I Implications**  
- Recognizes nonbinary gender beyond the traditional male/female binary.  
- Explicit “Prefer not to disclose” option supports employee privacy and consent.  
- Enables more accurate analysis of gender diversity and nonbinary inclusion.

---

## 3. Transgender Identity Data

**Question Asked**  
2. *“Do you identify as trans?”*

**Response Options**  
- Yes  
- No  
- Prefer not to say  

**ESG / DE&I Implications**  
- Explicit recognition of transgender identities, separate from gender category.  
- “Prefer not to say” respects confidentiality and reduces pressure to disclose.  
- Data can help identify potential disparities or needs specific to transgender employees (e.g., healthcare coverage, inclusive facilities, transition-related support), assuming it is handled confidentially and ethically.

## 4. Sexual Orientation Data

**Question Asked**  
3. *“Which of the following best describes your sexual orientation?”*

**Response Options**  
- Bi  
- Gay  
- Heterosexual (Straight)  
- Lesbian  
- Prefer not to say  

**ESG / DE&I Implications**  
- Explicit inclusion of multiple LGBTQ+ orientations (Bi, Gay, Lesbian) alongside heterosexual.  
- “Prefer not to say” protects those who are not comfortable disclosing.  
- This framework allows the organization to:  
  - Understand representation of LGBTQ+ employees.  
  - Monitor potential disparities in hiring, promotion, pay, engagement, and retention.  
  - Design and assess targeted inclusion initiatives, benefits, and training.

---

## 5. Privacy, Voluntariness, and Responsible Use

While not explicitly stated in the response, the presence of “Prefer not to disclose / Prefer not to say” indicates:

- The data is intended to be voluntary.  
- The organization acknowledges sensitivity around LGBTQ+ identity.  

From an ESG standpoint, responsible practice would also require:

- Strict confidentiality and restricted access to individual-level data.  
- Use of aggregated, anonymized data for analysis and reporting.  
- Clear internal communication about:  
  - Why this data is collected (e.g., to improve inclusion and equitable outcomes).  
  - How it will and will not be used (e.g., non-discrimination, no impact on employment decisions).  

---

## 6. Overall LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility Summary

Based on the described questions and options, the organization:

- **Affirmatively recognizes** gender diversity (including nonbinary) and transgender identities.  
- **Affirmatively recognizes** different sexual orientations (Bi, Gay, Lesbian) beyond heterosexual.  
- **Provides opt-out options** (“Prefer not to disclose/say”) to protect employee autonomy.  
- **Establishes a structural basis** for monitoring LGBTQ+ representation and potentially identifying gaps in inclusion, equity, and support.

To fully meet strong ESG standards, these data-collection practices ideally support:

- Periodic analysis of LGBTQ+ employee outcomes (recruitment, development, advancement, turnover).  
- Tailored inclusion measures (ERGs, inclusive benefits, training).  
- Transparent communication around data protection and non-discrimination.",80%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation 1.

To make it clearer and more comprehensive, you might consider expanding and organizing the points slightly. Here's a refined version:

---

At JHI, we have implemented a variety of campaigns and strategies designed to create a safe and supportive environment for employees to disclose their self-identified DE&I data. These include:

- **Intersectionality and Allyship Training:** We conduct regular training sessions that focus on understanding the intersecting identities of our employees and fostering allyship across different groups. This helps raise awareness and empathy within the workplace.

- **Focused Programs on LGBTQ+ and Mental Health:** Tailored initiatives support these communities, ensuring their concerns are acknowledged and addressed, which promotes a culture of trust.

- **Promoting Role Models and Allies:** Highlighting the experiences and support of role models and allies helps normalize disclosures and demonstrates visible commitment from leadership and peers.

- **Adherence to Recognized Standards and Ratings:** We actively promote our achievement of certifications such as the iiBT Gold Standard and maintain our Human Rights Campaign rating. This signals our firm-wide commitment to inclusion and human rights.

- **Employee Education on the Importance of DE&I Data:** We regularly communicate the reasons why collecting DE&I data matters – emphasizing confidentiality, its role in shaping inclusive policies, and driving meaningful change.

Together, these strategies work to empower employees to feel safe, supported, and motivated to disclose their DE",100%,"**LGBTQ+ DE&I – Comfort Around Disclosing Self‑ID Data**  

The employee response indicates that JHI is taking multiple, complementary steps to increase employees’ comfort and trust in disclosing self-identification (self‑ID) DE&I data, including LGBTQ+ identity. These can be grouped into several responsibility areas:

---

### 1. Building Understanding of *Why* Self‑ID Data Matters  

- **Education on the purpose of data collection**  
  JHI explicitly “educated employees on why we need this information.”  
  - This is a core DE&I responsibility: explaining that self‑ID data informs fair policies, resource allocation, benefits, and inclusion initiatives, rather than being collected for punitive or invasive purposes.  
  - It helps reduce anxiety and suspicion, supporting informed, voluntary disclosure.

---

### 2. Psychological Safety Through Training and Awareness  

- **Intersectionality and allyship training**  
  - Demonstrates awareness that individuals may hold multiple overlapping identities (e.g., LGBTQ+, racial minority, disability, mental health conditions).  
  - Allyship training signals that colleagues and leaders are expected to actively support marginalized groups, which can increase perceived safety in sharing personal information.  

- **LGBTQ+ and mental health focus**  
  - Training and campaigns that explicitly address LGBTQ+ issues and mental health normalize discussion of these topics and combat stigma.  
  - This approach shows that the organization recognizes the specific vulnerabilities of LGBTQ+ employees (e.g., fear of discrimination, outing, or career impact) and is working to address them.

---

### 3. Visibility of Role Models and Allies  

- **Promoting role models and allies**  
  - Highlighting visible LGBTQ+ employees and vocal allies at different levels of seniority indicates that being “out” and self-identifying does not prevent progression or leadership opportunities.  
  - This visibility is a key responsibility for inclusive employers: it shows that disclosure can coexist with career success and acceptance, which lowers perceived risk.

---

### 4. External Standards and Accountability Signals  

- **Promotion of iiBT Gold Standard and Human Rights Campaign rating**  
  - Publicizing strong external benchmarks for LGBTQ+ equality (e.g., HRC Corporate Equality Index, “Gold Standard” type accreditations) is used to reinforce trust that policies and practices are aligned with best‑in‑class LGBTQ+ inclusion.  
  - This communicates that the organization is accountable to external standards, not only internal statements, which can reassure employees that their data will be handled in a rights‑respecting, equitable manner.

---

### 5. Overall Strategic Approach  

Taken together, JHI is assuming the following DE&I responsibilities to support LGBTQ+ and broader self‑ID disclosure:

1. **Transparency and education** – explaining the rationale, use, and value of DE&I data.  
2. **Culture of safety and inclusion** – using intersectionality, allyship, LGBTQ+ and mental health training to build a supportive environment.  
3. **Representation and leadership signaling** – promoting role models and visible allies to normalize openness.  
4. **External validation of commitment** – leveraging recognized standards and ratings to demonstrate seriousness and accountability on LGBTQ+ equality.

These approaches, while not detailing technical aspects like data privacy controls or consent mechanisms, collectively focus on **trust-building, cultural change, and visible commitment**, all of which are essential preconditions for employees to feel comfortable and empowered to disclose their self‑ID DE&I data.",100%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,We post our open roles on the following LGBT+ job boards: - LGBT Great - Lgbtjobsite.com - MygWorks,,"Your response is a good start by highlighting specific LGBTQ+ job boards where you post open roles. To make it more comprehensive and demonstrate a stronger commitment to attracting LGBTQ+ talent, consider expanding your answer with additional strategies, such as:

- Partnering with LGBTQ+ professional networks and organizations to increase visibility.
- Participating in or sponsoring LGBTQ+ career fairs and events.
- Promoting an inclusive company culture through your employer branding and social media.
- Offering employee resource groups (ERGs) or affinity groups for LGBTQ+ employees.
- Providing diversity and inclusion training to all employees and leadership.
- Sharing testimonials or success stories from LGBTQ+ employees.

Here is a revised example response incorporating these points:

---

We actively target and attract LGBTQ+ talent through a variety of channels. We post our open roles on dedicated LGBTQ+ job boards such as LGBT Great, Lgbtjobsite.com, and MygWorks to ensure we reach the community directly. Additionally, we partner with LGBTQ+ professional networks and participate in pride events and career fairs to engage with potential candidates. 

Our commitment to inclusion is reflected in our employer branding, where we highlight our supportive and diverse workplace culture, including employee resource groups for LGBTQ+ team members. We also provide regular diversity and inclusion training to foster a supportive environment for everyone. By combining targeted recruitment with an inclusive culture, we strive to attract and retain talented LGBTQ+ professionals.

### 1. Targeted Outreach to LGBTQ+ Communities  
The organisation proactively seeks LGBTQ+ candidates by advertising open roles on dedicated LGBTQ+ job platforms, rather than relying solely on generalist job boards. This indicates recognition that underrepresented groups may not be reached effectively through standard channels.

### 2. Use of Specialist LGBTQ+ Job Boards  
The company posts vacancies on multiple LGBTQ+‑focused job boards, including:

- **LGBT Great** – a platform and network focused on LGBT+ inclusion, particularly within financial and professional services.  
- **Lgbtjobsite.com** – a job board specifically aimed at LGBTQ+ professionals, helping connect inclusive employers with LGBTQ+ jobseekers.  
- **MygWorks** – another LGBTQ+‑oriented employment platform designed to increase visibility of roles from inclusive employers.

Using several specialist boards broadens reach across different segments of the LGBTQ+ community and geographies.

### 3. Signal of Inclusive Employer Branding  
By consistently partnering with recognised LGBTQ+ job sites, the organisation:

- Sends a visible signal to prospective candidates that it welcomes LGBTQ+ applicants.  
- Positions itself as an employer that is at least partly engaged with LGBTQ+ inclusion and external LGBTQ+ networks.  

This contributes to building an employer brand that appears safer and more attractive to LGBTQ+ talent.

### 4. Scope and Limitations (Implied)  
The response demonstrates:

- **Strength**: Clear, tactical measures for attracting LGBTQ+ candidates via targeted job boards.  
- **Potential gaps** (not covered in the response):  
  - No detail on inclusive language in job ads, benefits, or policies.  
  - No mention of LGBTQ+ employee resource groups, community partnerships, or internal training.  
  - No explanation of how candidates’ experiences are supported throughout recruitment and onboarding.

To fully meet best‑practice LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities, these job‑board actions are a useful component but would typically be complemented by internal policies, inclusive culture initiatives, and measurable diversity outcomes.",80%,46ef82a559454c6ca1181e78b607dfa0,How does your organisation seek to position itself as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer?,"We leverage our sponsorship of community-based organizations such as LGBT Great, The Center, Envision: You and others as a way to promote ourselves as an LGBT+ inclusive employer.

Wording: In line with our Inclusion & Diversity Policy, Beazley commits to recruit, retain and develop people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to thrive at all levels of our business, in a truly inclusive environment that operates zero tolerance to discrimination or harassment and fully supports and celebrates differences. This guide is for all managers and colleagues and is designed to provide support and information to assist anyone going through the transitioning process and once they have transitioned. ‘Trans’ is an overarching term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not align comfortably with the sex they were assigned at birth. Transitioning involves the various steps a trans person may take to live in the gender with which they identify. Each person’s experience will be different. For some this involves medical intervention but not all trans people will have this. Transitioning may also involve changing pronouns, telling friends, family or colleagues, dressing differently or changing official documents and we understand that the levels of support an individual may require will vary. If an individual is considering transition, there are a number of things we can do at Beazley to support them. We encourage the individual to speak with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner in the first instance. Confidentiality Trans and non-binary colleagues will take the lead as to whether, when and how they wish to discuss their status. We understand some people may want to keep their gender identity private where others may wish to discuss either in confidence or more openly. We will respect the rights of the individual and great care will be taken not to do anything or share any information that breaches this confidentiality. Any information gathered by Beazley is held securely and only accessed by authorised colleagues with a legitimate need for the information. Absences from work We appreciate individuals may need to be away from work for medical appointments or surgical procedures as well as recovery time. The individual may also wish to work remotely for a period of time while undergoing any procedures. The individual should discuss any planned absences in advance with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner so the appropriate leave policies can be applied or adjustments made. We encourage the line manager and individual to remain in contact during any absences to agree any return to work plans or discuss any further adjustments that may be required. Communication The individual will confirm their details, the date effective and by what pronouns they wish to be addressed in the business moving forwards by discussing with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner. The C&P team will ensure records, directories, email accounts and so on are updated accordingly. The individual and their line manager should discuss how the individual wishes to communicate to others in the team or wider business of their name or pronoun change and agree how this should be done. Should the team or manager require more support, the C&P Business Partner or Inclusion Partner will be able to advise. It will be made clear that any transphobic or discriminatory comments will not be tolerated. Examples of this could be not respecting someone’s pronouns continued use of a trans person’s “deadname” (birth name or name they used prior to transitioning), being subjected to derogatory remarks about their gender identity, being “outed” or excluded as a result of their gender identity. Beazley operates a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination and any examples of transphobic bullying or harassment will be investigated fully. Facilities & Dress Code All colleagues are entitled to use the toilet or changing facilities appropriate to the gender in which they align with, regardless of whether they are currently undergoing or have undergone any gender reassignment. A number of Beazley offices have gender-neutral facilities which are available to use for all colleagues to use too. Beazley have a ‘dress for the day’ gender-neutral policy so individuals are empowered to use their own judgement on what to wear given their working day.

The employee’s response indicates that the company collects voluntary demographic data related to gender identity and sexual orientation as part of its DE&I practices. This information is used to better understand workforce composition and support inclusive policies and programs.

---

### 1. Gender Identity Question

**Question Asked**  
- “What word best describes your gender?”

**Response Options**  
- Male  
- Female  
- Non-binary  
- Prefer not to say  

**DE&I Implications**  
- Recognizes that not all employees identify strictly as male or female by explicitly including a *non-binary* option.
- Respects privacy and psychological safety by including *prefer not to say*, allowing employees to opt out without penalty.
- Lacks a “self-describe” option for more nuanced identities (e.g., genderqueer, genderfluid), which may limit inclusivity for some employees.

---

### 2. Sexual Orientation Question

**Question Asked**  
- “What best describes your sexuality?”

**Response Options**  
- Gay/lesbian  
- Bisexual  
- Heterosexual  
- Prefer to self-describe  
- Prefer not to say  

**DE&I Implications**  
- Explicitly includes LGBTQ+ identities (*gay/lesbian*, *bisexual*), which signals recognition and validation of sexual minorities.
- Allows *prefer to self-describe*, which accommodates a broader range of identities (e.g., pansexual, asexual, queer), adding flexibility and inclusivity.
- *Prefer not to say* supports confidentiality and reduces pressure to disclose sensitive personal information.

---

### 3. ESG & DE&I Responsibility Assessment

- **Inclusion of LGBTQ+ Identities**:  
  The framework explicitly acknowledges LGBTQ+ employees through both sexual orientation and non-binary gender options, which is aligned with good DE&I practice.

- **Respect for Privacy and Consent**:  
  The presence of “prefer not to say” on both questions indicates attention to data protection, employee comfort, and voluntary disclosure—important from a human rights and ESG risk perspective.

- **Areas for Improvement**:  
  - Adding a “self-describe” option for gender (as already exists for sexuality) would better capture diverse gender identities and strengthen inclusivity.
  - Providing clear communication on:
    - Why this data is collected (e.g., to identify inequities and improve inclusion),
    - How it is stored and protected,
    - Who can access it and how it will be used,
    would further enhance trust and ESG alignment.

---

### Conclusion

The company demonstrates a structured and reasonably inclusive approach to collecting LGBTQ+ related data, with attention to non-binary identities, broader sexual orientation categories, and confidentiality. Strengthening the gender question with a “self-describe” option and reinforcing transparency around data use would further align this practice with leading LGBTQ+ DE&I and ESG standards.",10%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.","What word best describes your gender (male, female, non-binary, prefer not to say) We do not currently ask about gender transitions.",,fd6dda376f6f459792eb3900f7bf9076,How does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"We are able to cut the inclusion data by demographic group, and assess how included members of different sexualities feel.

   - The **Talent Acquisition (TA) team** has completed **inclusive recruitment training**.

   - The organization confirms that **none of the stakeholder groups selected in Q3 are formally or systematically assessed** against LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) goals or objectives on an annual basis.  
   - This means there is currently **no structured performance evaluation, KPIs, or annual review process** tied specifically to LGBTQ+ DE&I outcomes for these stakeholder groups.

2. **Pride Network Responsibilities**

   - The **Pride Network** appears to be the primary internal stakeholder with explicit LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities.  
   - **Who they are:**  
     - An internal employee resource group (ERG) or network focused on LGBTQ+ issues and inclusion within the organization.  
   - **How they are measured / how they operate:**  
     - The Pride Network **sets its own objectives annually**, focused on LGBTQ+ inclusion, awareness, and support.  
     - At the end of each year, the Pride Network **conducts a self-review** to assess whether it has met the objectives it defined.  
     - This is **self-assessment based**, not a formal performance evaluation imposed by senior management or HR.

3. **Integration into Broader DE&I Governance**

   - The results of the Pride Network’s annual self-assessment are **shared with the DEI Steering Committee**.  
   - These findings and reflections then **inform broader DE&I strategy, future projects, and objectives**, including LGBTQ+ priorities.  
   - In practice, this means:
     - The Pride Network’s experience and outcomes help to **shape organizational DE&I planning**, even though other stakeholder groups are not directly evaluated against LGBTQ+ metrics.
     - The Pride Network acts as a **key consultative and advisory stakeholder** in LGBTQ+ DE&I, rather than as a party held to formalized, top‑down targets.

Feedback on DEI work forms part of this process and can therefore influence reward.

To enhance clarity and impact, you might consider adding specific examples or highlighting any unique initiatives related to LGBTQ+ efforts. Here’s a refined version of your response:

---

Our organisation recognises and rewards employees who actively support LGBTQ+ DE&I through a combination of tangible and intangible rewards, aligned with the recognition given for other roles and projects within the firm.

Tangible rewards include annual pay reviews and bonuses, which factor in peer and colleague feedback on individual performance and contributions throughout the year. Importantly, feedback related to DE&I activities — including efforts supporting LGBTQ+ inclusion — is integrated into this process and can positively influence remuneration outcomes.

Intangible recognition comes through multiple internal channels. Employees leading LGBTQ+ DE&I initiatives or networks are publicly acknowledged via internal communications, such as newsletters and dedicated SharePoint pages, where their roles and contributions are highlighted. This ongoing visibility helps foster a culture of appreciation and encourages further engagement in DE&I work across the organisation.

Together, these approaches ensure that employees championing LGBTQ+ DE&I feel valued and motivated, reinforcing our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace.

1. **Overall Approach**  
   The organisation integrates LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions into its *standard performance and reward framework*, rather than treating them as separate or informal activities. Efforts in this area are recognised in both **tangible (financial)** and **intangible (non-financial)** ways, similar to other roles and projects.

2. **Tangible Rewards (Pay and Bonuses)**  
   - **Annual Review Process:**  
     - Pay and bonus decisions are reviewed annually.  
     - The review incorporates **colleague feedback** on each individual’s activities and performance.
   - **Inclusion of DE&I Work:**  
     - LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions are explicitly included in this feedback.  
     - As a result, **active and effective support for LGBTQ+ DE&I can positively influence compensation outcomes**, including salary progression and bonus awards.

3. **Intangible Recognition (Visibility and Appreciation)**  
   The organisation also provides structured non-financial recognition, focused on visibility, acknowledgement, and status:

   - **Internal Communications:**  
     - Named individuals leading LGBTQ+ DE&I projects are highlighted in internal communications.  
     - This public acknowledgment signals organisational value placed on DE&I work.
   
   - **Network Roles and Visibility:**  
     - Members of LGBTQ+ or broader DE&I networks have their roles **formally named and recognised on internal SharePoint pages**.  
     - This creates clear visibility of who is contributing and in what capacity.
   
   - **General Acknowledgement of Contributions:**  
     - The organisation emphasises **general visibility and recognition** of each person’s contribution to LGBTQ+ DE&I initiatives.  
     - This may include references in team meetings, intranet posts, or leadership messages, reinforcing the importance of these efforts.

4. **Integration into Performance Culture**  
   - LGBTQ+ DE&I work is embedded as a **legitimate, valued component of performance**, rather than an optional add-on.  
   - The combination of financial impact (through pay/bonus) and reputational/visibility benefits (through internal recognition) encourages employees to meaningfully support LGBTQ+ inclusion and equity as part of their core role.",100%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","Internal/ external training: The firm provides training sessions, open to all employees, as part of the LGBT+ committee Pride month on an annual basis.

1. **Internal Visibility of LGBTQ+ Role Models and Allies**  
   - The organization highlights LGBTQ+ role models and allies from its Pride Network.  
   - Primary internal channel: Viva Engage (workplace social platform).  
     - Content is shared as internal posts.  
     - Reach is limited to employees who have chosen to subscribe to these updates, meaning visibility is relatively low across the wider workforce.  
   - Secondary internal channel: Firmwide email communications.  
     - These occur occasionally, approximately every six months.

2. **External Visibility and Advocacy**  
   - The organization promotes Pride Network role models and allies through external-facing channels, especially around Pride Month.  
   - Channels used:

Based on the employee’s response, the organization has the following LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) practices and implied responsibilities:

---

### 1. Sexual Orientation Question

**Question Asked:**
- “Which of the following best describes your sexual orientation?”

**Purpose (Implied DE&I Responsibility):**
- To collect data on sexual orientation as part of understanding workforce diversity.
- To support inclusion efforts by recognizing different sexual orientations within the employee population.

---

### 2. Response Options Provided

Employees can select from the following options:

1. **Straight/Heterosexual**  
2. **Gay or Lesbian**  
3. **Bisexual**  
4. **Other sexual orientation**  
5. **Do not wish to disclose**

**DE&I Implications:**

- **Recognition of LGBTQ+ Identities:**  
  By including “Gay or Lesbian,” “Bisexual,” and “Other sexual orientation,” the organization acknowledges that employees may identify as LGBTQ+ and/or outside traditional labels.
  
- **Respect for Privacy and Consent:**  
  - The option **“Do not wish to disclose”** indicates respect for employee privacy and voluntary self-identification.  
  - This supports psychological safety by allowing employees not to share sensitive personal information.

- **Non-Binary/Inclusive Category:**  
  - **“Other sexual orientation”** allows employees whose identities do not fit the listed categories to still be represented, which supports inclusivity beyond standard labels (e.g., pansexual, queer, asexual, etc.).

---

### 3. Key LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities Reflected

From this structure, the organization is implicitly responsible for:

1. **Voluntary and Confidential Data Collection**
   - Ensuring employees understand that disclosure is optional.
   - Protecting the confidentiality of sexual-orientation data and using it only for legitimate DE&I purposes.

2. **Inclusive Representation**
   - Recognizing multiple sexual orientations and avoiding a binary or heteronormative-only framework.
   - Providing an “Other” category to reflect a wider spectrum of identities.

3. **Non-Discrimination and Safe Use of Data**
   - Using this information to monitor and improve equity and inclusion, not for decisions that could lead to discrimination or harassment.
   - Ensuring policies and practices are aligned with the protection of LGBTQ+ employees.

4. **Transparency of Purpose**
   - Clearly explaining why this question is asked (e.g., to track representation, improve policies, and identify gaps in inclusion).

---

### 4. Areas for Potential Enhancement (If Strengthening DE&I)

While not stated, organizations committed to strong LGBTQ+ DE&I often:

- Provide **clear communication** about how the data will be used, stored, and protected.
- Link this data collection to **concrete measures**, such as:
  - LGBTQ+ inclusion policies and benefits
  - Anti-discrimination and anti-harassment protections
  - Employee resource groups (ERGs) for LGBTQ+ staff
- Periodically **review and update options and language** to stay aligned with evolving best practices and terminology.

4. **Inclusive Recruitment Communications & Language**  
   - The organisation **regularly reviews the language** used in job adverts and candidate communications to ensure it is **inclusive and non-exclusionary**.

     - Avoid heteronormative, cisnormative, or gendered language that might deter LGBTQ+ candidates.  
     - Encourage more diverse applicants by using neutral, welcoming, and bias-mitigated wording.

5. **Respect for Identity – Titles and Pronouns**  
   - The organisation explicitly states it **does not make assumptions about a candidate’s title or preferred pronouns**.  
   - This implies responsibility to:  
     - Use **neutral forms of address** unless and until preferences are known.  
     - Create space for candidates to **self-identify their pronouns and titles**.  
   - This practice is an important signal of respect for **trans, non-binary, and gender-diverse** candidates, and supports psychological safety from the first contact.

*(Inferred from the awards listed in the employee response)*

The employee’s response lists several “Women in Pensions Awards 2024” categories and recognitions. While these awards are not explicitly LGBTQ+-specific, they demonstrate organizational behaviors and responsibilities that are closely aligned with broader DE&I (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) principles, many of which are also relevant to LGBTQ+ inclusion.

#### 1. Gender Diversity and Advancement

- **Awards listed:**
  - Adviser of the Year  
  - Young Achiever of the Year (2 people shortlisted from BW)  
  - Newcomer of the Year  
  - Administrator of the Year (2 people shortlisted from BW)  

- **Implications for DE&I responsibilities:**
  - The organization appears to actively support and promote women’s progression in the pensions/advice sector, which is traditionally male‑dominated.
  - Recognition across levels (young achiever, newcomer, adviser, administrator) suggests a commitment to building inclusive talent pipelines and reducing structural barriers to advancement.
  - This gender-focused inclusion work is an important component of a broader DE&I strategy that can and should extend to LGBTQ+ employees (e.g., ensuring promotion, recognition, and role-modelling for LGBTQ+ staff as well).

#### 2. Recognition of Under‑represented and Often Invisible Contributions

- **Award listed:**
  - Unsung Hero Award  

- **Implications for DE&I responsibilities:**
  - Valuing “unsung heroes” indicates attention to those whose work is often overlooked—frequently a problem for people from under‑represented or marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ employees.
  - This type of recognition framework can underpin:
    - Fair credit for work performed by minoritized employees.
    - Greater visibility of diverse role models.
    - Cultural norms that celebrate contributions beyond traditional, high‑profile roles.

#### 3. External Benchmarking and Accountability

- **Nature of awards:**
  - Industry‑recognized, third‑party awards.

- **Implications for DE&I responsibilities:**
  - Seeking or receiving external recognition signals that the organization:
    - Submits itself to external scrutiny regarding fairness, representation, and merit.
    - Uses sector benchmarks to validate and improve its inclusion practices.
  - This mindset is transferable to LGBTQ+ DE&I: the same mechanisms (external awards, indices, or charters focused on LGBTQ+ equality) can be used to track progress and drive accountability.

#### 4. Intersectional Approach (Potential and Expectations)

- Although the awards are framed around women in pensions, they open the door to an **intersectional approach**:
  - Women who are also LGBTQ+, people of color, disabled, or from other under‑represented backgrounds can benefit from such recognition.
  - A robust LGBTQ+ DE&I strategy would ensure that:
    - Women’s recognition programs are inclusive of trans women and non‑binary people aligned with women’s networks.
    - Selection and nomination processes for awards explicitly consider and welcome LGBTQ+ participation.

## 1. Stakeholder Group: DE&I Team

**Who They Are**  
The DE&I (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) Team is the internal function responsible for designing, overseeing, and driving the company’s inclusion and diversity strategy. In this context, they are specifically accountable for the LGBTQ+ dimension of DE&I.

- Integrate LGBTQ+ representation as a defined objective within the company’s long-term DE&I strategy.  
- Coordinate initiatives, policies, and programs aimed at increasing LGBTQ+ representation and fostering a more inclusive culture.

**How They Are Measured Against LGBTQ+ DE&I Goals**  
- **Representation Targets:** The team’s performance is measured in part by progress toward the 2030 I&D aspiration that explicitly includes a goal on LGBT+ representation (e.g., increased share of LGBTQ+ employees in the workforce or leadership).  
- **Strategic Implementation:** Success is assessed via the design and rollout of initiatives that support those representation goals (such as inclusive policies, employee resource groups, training, and visibility campaigns).

Unfortunately, I cannot attach files, but I can help draft or summarize the policies if you provide their content.",0%,"Below is an ESG‑style analysis of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities based on the employee’s response.

---

## 1. Overall Assessment

The response given:

> “Please see previous question”

does **not** provide:
- Any policy names or excerpts  
- Any description of LGBTQ+ or broader DE&I responsibilities  
- Any attached or referenced documents  

From an ESG and DE&I standpoint, this answer is **insufficient** and **non‑responsive** to the question asked.

---

## 2. Expected Content vs. Actual Content

### What Q6 Follow‑Up Typically Requires
For “each of the selected options in Q6,” the respondent would normally be expected to:

1. **List specific policies** (e.g., “Equal Employment Opportunity Policy,” “Anti‑Discrimination and Harassment Policy,” “Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Policy,” “Code of Conduct,” “Transgender Inclusion Guidelines,” “Benefits & Family Leave Policy,” etc.).
2. **Provide supporting commentary**, such as:
   - Scope of the policy (who it covers, including explicit mention of sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, and other protected characteristics).
   - How the policy is implemented (training, reporting mechanisms, disciplinary processes).
   - Evidence of practice (examples of LGBTQ+ inclusion initiatives, ERGs, benefits policies, inclusive facilities, etc.).
3. **Attach or reference copies of the policies**, typically via:
   - File attachments  
   - URLs to policy documents  
   - In‑line excerpts or summaries

### What Was Actually Provided
- No policy titles  
- No policy content or explanation  
- No attachments  
- No explicit LGBTQ+ content  

The answer simply defers to a “previous question,” which is not included here and, even if it exists, does not satisfy the explicit requirement to **attach or restate specific policies** in this response.

---

## 3. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility

From this response alone, several issues arise:

1. **Lack of Transparency**  
   - There is no clear evidence of any LGBTQ+‑relevant policies.
   - Stakeholders cannot verify if sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression are explicitly protected.

2. **Inability to Assess Policy Quality**  
   Without the text or summary of policies, it is impossible to determine:
   - Whether non‑discrimination and anti‑harassment protections cover LGBTQ+ employees explicitly.
   - Whether the organization has guidelines for inclusive language, transitioning at work, facilities access, pronouns, etc.
   - Whether benefits (healthcare, parental leave, partners/spouses) are equitably available to LGBTQ+ employees and families.

3. **Weak Evidence of Governance and Accountability**  
   ESG reviewers expect:
   - Documented policies
   - Clear responsibilities (e.g., HR, DE&I Officer, senior leadership)
   - Mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement

   The response gives no indication of who is accountable for LGBTQ+ inclusion or how compliance is measured or enforced.

---

## 4. Recommended Clarifications and Next Steps

To align with good ESG and DE&I practice, the organization (or respondent) should:

1. **Explicitly List Relevant Policies**
   At minimum:
   - Equal Employment Opportunity / Non‑Discrimination Policy  
   - Anti‑Harassment and Anti‑Bullying Policy  
   - Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Policy (or equivalent)  
   - Code of Conduct  
   - Any LGBTQ+‑specific guidance (e.g., gender transition policy, inclusive facilities policy)

2. **Confirm Explicit LGBTQ+ Coverage**
   For each relevant policy, clearly indicate if it explicitly references:
   - Sexual orientation  
   - Gender identity  
   - Gender expression  
   - Same‑sex spouses/partners and families

3. **Provide Supporting Commentary**
   For each policy:
   - Purpose and scope  
   - Implementation (training, communication, onboarding)  
   - Reporting and remediation processes (whistleblowing lines, HR processes, non‑retaliation)  
   - Monitoring and review (how often reviewed, who approves changes)

4. **Attach or Link Policy Documents**
   - Upload PDF or official policy files, or  
   - Provide public URLs, or  
   - Paste the full text or substantial excerpts if attachments cannot be provided.

## 5. Conclusion

The given response does **not** provide any usable information on LGBTQ+ or broader DE&I responsibilities and fails to meet the request to list and attach policies. For ESG evaluation, this is effectively **no evidence** of formal LGBTQ+ DE&I protections. The organization should provide explicit, documented policies and commentary to demonstrate a credible, enforceable commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",0%,827bdf404cd34631b6f0a1f51336ab77,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",Sexual Orientation?

Based on the employee’s response, the organization is collecting self‑reported data on **sexual orientation** as part of its DE&I efforts. This creates several responsibilities in terms of design, protection, and use of this information.

### 1. Question Asked

- **“Sexual Orientation?”**

This is a direct demographic question relating to LGBTQ+ identity and broader sexual orientation categories.

### 2. Response Options Provided

Employees can select from the following options:

- **Bi**
- **Gay Man**
- **Gay Woman / Lesbian**
- **Heterosexual / Straight**
- **Other**
- **Prefer not to say**

This structure:

- Recognizes multiple LGBTQ+ identities (bisexual, gay man, gay woman/lesbian).
- Includes non‑LGBTQ+ identity (heterosexual/straight).
- Provides an **“Other”** option, allowing space for identities not listed.
- Includes **“Prefer not to say”**, acknowledging privacy and consent.

### 3. Implicit DE&I Responsibilities

Collecting this type of sensitive data implies several key responsibilities:

1. **Voluntariness & Consent**
   - Ensure employees understand that answering is **optional**, and “Prefer not to say” is a fully acceptable choice.
   - Communicate clearly how and why the data will be used (e.g., monitoring inclusion, informing DE&I programs).

2. **Privacy & Confidentiality**
   - Treat sexual orientation data as **sensitive personal information**.
   - Limit access to aggregated or anonymized data only.
   - Prohibit use of individual responses in performance, promotion, or other employment decisions.

3. **Inclusion & Respectful Categorization**
   - Periodically review categories to:
     - Ensure they remain inclusive and respectful.
     - Consider whether additional explicit options (e.g., pansexual, asexual, queer) may be appropriate, while balancing simplicity and privacy risks.
   - Use neutral, non‑judgmental wording and consistent terminology.

4. **Non‑Discrimination & Protection**
   - Explicitly confirm that disclosure of any sexual orientation **will not** result in discrimination or retaliation.
   - Align internal practices with relevant legal protections for LGBTQ+ employees.

5. **Data Use & Transparency**
   - Use the data only for **legitimate DE&I purposes**, such as:
     - Tracking representation and inclusion outcomes.
     - Identifying inequities in engagement, promotion, or retention.
     - Designing targeted support initiatives.
   - Share only **aggregated statistics** (e.g., at department or company level) to avoid re‑identification.

6. **Data Governance & Retention**
   - Define clear retention periods and secure storage methods.
   - Allow employees to **update or withdraw** their information where feasible.
   - Ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR‑like standards where relevant).

---

In summary, the organization is directly asking employees to self‑identify their sexual orientation with multiple LGBTQ+ options and privacy‑protective choices. This practice carries responsibilities around voluntariness, confidentiality, non‑discrimination, respectful representation, and careful governance of sensitive DE&I data.",30%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",What best describes your gender?

Here's a polished version that highlights your strategies clearly:

---

To improve comfort around disclosing self-ID DE&I data, our organization has focused on transparency and empowerment. We clearly communicate how the data is stored and the reasons behind its collection, ensuring individuals understand that their information is handled securely and confidentially. Additionally, we empower business areas to actively encourage completion of DE&I data within their teams, fostering a supportive environment.

Looking ahead, we plan to embed this approach at the new starter stage by introducing it during induction sessions. This will help set expectations early and normalize the practice of sharing self-ID information as part of our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

---

If you’d like, I can help draft further communications or suggest additional strategies to enhance comfort and participation.",100%,"**Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Self‑ID Data Strategies**

1. **Data Transparency & Trust-Building**  
   - The organization emphasizes **clear communication about how self‑ID data is stored, protected, and used**.  
   - By explaining **why** DE&I data is collected (e.g., to identify gaps, improve policies, support underrepresented groups), they aim to **build trust and reduce concern** among employees about disclosure.  
   - This approach aligns with best practice in LGBTQ+ inclusion, where **confidentiality, purpose clarity, and data minimization** are essential to making individuals feel safe disclosing sensitive information.

2. **Empowering Leaders to Encourage Participation**  
   - Business areas and team leaders are **encouraged and empowered** to promote completion of self‑ID data within their teams.  
   - This implies:
     - Providing **guidance or talking points** for managers on how to discuss DE&I data respectfully and non-coercively.  
     - Positioning self‑ID completion as a **positive, voluntary contribution** to more inclusive practices.  
   - Manager-level engagement can be particularly important for LGBTQ+ staff, as **local culture and leadership behavior** often determine how safe disclosure feels in practice.

3. **Integration into the New Starter / Induction Process (Planned)**  
   - The organization plans to **embed self‑ID DE&I data collection in the induction process** for new employees.  
   - By incorporating this at onboarding, they:
     - Normalize DE&I self‑identification **from day one** as a standard, routine part of joining the organization.  
     - Have an opportunity to **explain protections, anonymity, and usage** of data early, before fears or misinformation can take hold.  
   - For LGBTQ+ inclusion, early clarity can mitigate concerns about outing, discrimination, or misuse of data.

---

**Overall Assessment**

- The organization is focusing on **three core levers** to improve comfort with DE&I self‑ID, including LGBTQ+ data:
  1. **Transparent communication** on data storage, privacy, and purpose.  
  2. **Manager and business-area engagement** to encourage voluntary participation.  
  3. **Onboarding integration** to normalize and explain self‑ID early in the employee lifecycle.

- These actions support a more **informed, trust-based environment** that can make LGBTQ+ employees more comfortable sharing their identities, provided they are accompanied by:
  - Strong **data protection controls** and clear non-retaliation commitments.  
  - Visible **LGBTQ+ inclusive policies and culture**, so employees see that disclosure leads to support, not risk.",80%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,"We attract LGBTQ+ talent in the same way as we would attract talent of any kind- through use of recruiters and job boards as well as sharing jobs on our own site. We have reviewed/tested LGBTQ+ job boards previously but not been impressed at the look/usability or inability to assess how much talent is actually being driven through this mechanism,. We will be looking to review again next year.",,"The response indicates that the organisation currently attracts LGBTQ+ talent primarily through general recruitment methods, such as using recruiters, job boards, and sharing jobs on its own website. While they have previously explored specialized LGBTQ+ job boards, they found issues with their usability and effectiveness in driving talent. However, the organisation plans to reassess these options in the future.

If you are seeking ways to enhance targeting and attracting LGBTQ+ talent specifically, you might consider suggesting or exploring additional strategies such as:

- Partnering with LGBTQ+ professional networks and community organizations  
- Promoting inclusive workplace policies and benefits prominently in job postings  
- Highlighting employee resource groups or diversity initiatives on your careers page  
- Participating in or sponsoring LGBTQ+ career fairs and events  
- Training recruiters and hiring managers on inclusive recruitment practices  

These steps can help demonstrate a genuine commitment to diversity and inclusion, making your organisation more appealing to LGBTQ+ candidates.",100%,"Below is a structured ESG-style summary of the organisation’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and current practices as implied by the response.

---

## 1. Talent Attraction Strategy

**General approach**

- The organisation uses **standard recruitment channels** to attract LGBTQ+ talent:
  - External recruiters
  - General job boards
  - The organisation’s own careers site

- LGBTQ+ candidates are **not targeted through specific, tailored outreach**; instead, they are expected to be reached via the same mechanisms used for all candidates.

**Implications**

- This indicates a **universalist approach** (same process for everyone) rather than a **targeted DE&I recruitment strategy** for LGBTQ+ communities.
- There is no evidence of dedicated employer branding, inclusive messaging, or specific community outreach aimed at LGBTQ+ talent.

---

## 2. Use of LGBTQ+-Specific Job Boards

**Past engagement**

- The organisation has **reviewed and tested LGBTQ+-specific job boards** in the past.
- It discontinued or reduced use due to:
  - Dissatisfaction with **look and usability** of platforms.
  - **Inability to assess ROI** or measure how much talent those boards were actually driving.

**Current status**

- At present, there is **no regular or systematic use** of LGBTQ+-specific job boards.
- LGBTQ+-specific platforms are not a formal part of the attraction strategy.

**Implications**

- The organisation has shown **some exploratory intent** toward LGBTQ+-focused recruitment channels.
- However, the lack of metrics/analytics and concerns about user experience have limited long-term adoption.
- This suggests an opportunity to:
  - Set clearer KPIs for diversity-focused channels.
  - Work with providers that offer better analytics and UX.
  - Integrate these platforms more strategically within broader DE&I goals.

---

## 3. Plans for Future Review and Improvement

**Stated intention**

- The organisation plans to **review LGBTQ+-specific job boards again next year**.

**Potential areas of evolution**

- Reassessment of:
  - Platform quality and accessibility.
  - Candidate volume and relevance.
  - Tracking and reporting capabilities to demonstrate impact.
- Opportunity to align this review with:
  - A broader **LGBTQ+ inclusion strategy**.
  - More structured **DE&I recruitment targets** and success measures.

---

## 4. Gaps Relative to Strong LGBTQ+ DE&I Practices

While not explicitly stated by the company, the response reveals several gaps when benchmarked against stronger ESG/DE&I practices:

1. **Lack of targeted outreach**
   - No mention of:
     - Partnerships with LGBTQ+ professional networks, student groups, or community organisations.
     - Participation in LGBTQ+ career fairs, conferences, or events.

2. **Limited inclusive employer branding**
   - No reference to:
     - LGBTQ+-inclusive language and imagery in job adverts.
     - Public statements of support (e.g., website content, social media campaigns, Pride engagement).
     - Showcasing LGBTQ+ employee stories or ERG activity (if any).

3. **Minimal measurement of LGBTQ+ recruitment outcomes**
   - Difficulty measuring impact of LGBTQ+-specific job boards indicates **insufficient data-tracking frameworks** for LGBTQ+ attraction metrics.

4. **No explicit policies or commitments referenced**
   - The answer does not mention:
     - Non-discrimination policies that explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity.
     - LGBTQ+-inclusive benefits or workplace policies as part of the attraction strategy.
     - Internal training or awareness initiatives that might indirectly attract LGBTQ+ talent.

---

## 5. Overall ESG/DE&I Assessment (Based on the Response Only)

- **Current posture**:  
  - Relies on **general recruitment practices** and is broadly neutral rather than explicitly proactive in attracting LGBTQ+ talent.
  - Some **prior experimentation** with LGBTQ+-specific channels, but no sustained, structured use.

- **Commitment signals**:  
  - Willingness to **revisit LGBTQ+ job boards** suggests **openness to improvement**, though it remains at an exploratory stage rather than a robust strategy.

- **Opportunity for advancement**:  
  - To align more strongly with best-in-class ESG/DE&I standards, the organisation could:
    - Develop a **formal LGBTQ+ recruitment strategy** with clear goals and metrics.
    - Combine **targeted outreach**, **inclusive branding**, and **data-driven evaluation** of channels.
    - Integrate attraction efforts with broader **LGBTQ+ inclusion policies and practices** inside the organisation.",85%,46ef82a559454c6ca1181e78b607dfa0,How does your organisation seek to position itself as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer?,"Please see some examples below: 1.

Based on the employee’s response, the organization’s LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) responsibilities and activities can be summarized as follows:

---

### 1. Education & Awareness

**Actions Taken:**
- **Hosted two LGBTQ+ educational webinars in February**
  - Purpose:  
    - Increase general awareness of LGBTQ+ issues in the workplace and broader society.  
    - Provide employees with knowledge on topics such as inclusive language, allyship, understanding different identities, and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals.
  - Likely DE&I Outcomes:  
    - Builds a more informed and empathetic workforce.  
    - Encourages inclusive behaviors and reduces bias or misunderstanding.  
    - Supports a culture in which LGBTQ+ employees feel seen and respected.

### 2. Community Support & Philanthropy

**Actions Taken:**
- **Fundraised for Micro Rainbow**
  - Purpose:

To directly address how employees are recognised and rewarded for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I, you might consider elaborating on specific mechanisms or examples of rewards. Here's a refined version of your response with added clarity:

---

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) is a cornerstone of our firm’s corporate sustainability strategy, with dedicated focus areas including LGBTQ+, women, disabilities, and race. To encourage and reward employee contributions to DE&I, we integrate these efforts into our annual performance assessments. Employees who actively support and advance LGBTQ+ initiatives—as well as other DE&I streams—earn additional points during their evaluations. These additive points recognize their positive impact on sustainability goals for our clients, our firm, and the communities we serve. This approach not only acknowledges individual efforts but also fosters a culture where DE&I commitments are valued and incentivised.

If you would like, I can also help you draft specific examples or describe other forms of recognition beyond performance points, such as awards, public acknowledgments, or development opportunities.",100%,"Below is a structured ESG-style summary of the organisation’s LGBTQ+ DE&I recognition and reward practices based on the response provided.

---

## 1. Strategic Positioning of LGBTQ+ DE&I

- **Integrated into Corporate Sustainability Strategy**  
  - DE&I is identified as one of the **three main pillars** of the firm’s overarching corporate sustainability strategy.  
  - LGBTQ+ inclusion is therefore not treated as an isolated HR initiative, but as a **core strategic component** of how the firm defines and delivers sustainability.

- **Thematic DE&I Streams**  
  The DE&I pillar is operationalised through four thematic streams:
  1. LGBTQ
  2. Women
  3. Disabilities
  4. Race  

  This structure indicates that LGBTQ+ issues are addressed through a **dedicated stream**, ensuring visibility and focus equal to other key diversity dimensions.

---

## 2. Mechanisms for Recognition and Reward

- **Performance Assessment Linkage**  
  - Employees can earn **additive points in their annual assessment** for positive DE&I contributions.  
  - These additional points directly influence formal performance evaluations, and therefore can impact:
    - Overall performance ratings  
    - Eligibility for bonuses or variable compensation (where applicable)  
    - Promotion and career progression considerations  
    
- **Scope of Recognised Contributions**  
  Positive contributions that can be recognised with additive assessment points include activities that:
  - Support **sustainability for clients** (e.g., integrating DE&I, including LGBTQ+ inclusion, into client solutions, advisory work, or projects)
  - Enhance sustainability within **the firm itself** (e.g., participation in the LGBTQ stream, internal awareness initiatives, policy or culture improvements)
  - Benefit **the communities in which the firm operates** (e.g., volunteering, partnerships, advocacy, or outreach focused on LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion)

- **Incentivisation Effect**  
  - By embedding LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts into the formal performance framework, the organisation **incentivises active engagement** rather than treating it as purely voluntary or extracurricular.  
  - This mechanism helps to normalise LGBTQ+ inclusion work as part of an employee’s **core, valued contribution** to the firm.

---

## 3. Implications and Good Practice Indicators

- **Clear Accountability and Ownership**  
  The measurable, points-based approach creates accountability for contributing to LGBTQ+ and broader DE&I objectives, moving beyond symbolic commitments.

- **Alignment with ESG Best Practices**  
  - Tying DE&I (including LGBTQ+ efforts) to performance management is consistent with emerging ESG best practices, where:
    - Human capital management and inclusion are treated as **material ESG factors**.
    - Employee behaviours that advance social sustainability are **rewarded through formal systems**, not just informal recognition.

- **Holistic Impact Lens**  
  Recognition covers contributions at three levels:
  1. **Client** (external impact in products and services)
  2. **Firm** (internal culture, policies, and practices)
  3. **Community** (broader social impact)

  This signals a **holistic ESG approach** in which LGBTQ+ DE&I is relevant across all stakeholder groups.

---

## 4. Summary

The organisation recognises and rewards LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts by:

- Elevating DE&I, including LGBTQ+ inclusion, as a **core sustainability pillar**.
- Structuring LGBTQ+ work within a dedicated thematic stream alongside other key diversity areas.
- Providing **tangible performance incentives** (additive points in annual assessments) for employees who contribute to sustainability across clients, the firm, and communities, explicitly including DE&I contributions.

This creates a direct, formal link between LGBTQ+ DE&I engagement and individual career outcomes, reinforcing its strategic importance and encouraging widespread participation.",100%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","Internal training: We have an active ERG that leads the firm’s LGBTQ initiatives.

To make it clearer and more impactful, you could consider elaborating on specific practices or examples. Here’s a refined version you might use:

---

Our organisation recognises and rewards employees who actively support LGBTQ+ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) by ensuring their contributions are acknowledged during performance evaluations. When an employee demonstrates a meaningful commitment to advancing LGBTQ+ inclusion—such as leading initiatives, participating in ERGs (Employee Resource Groups), or advocating for inclusive policies—this feedback is communicated to management. These efforts are then taken into account during year-end bonus determinations and can also influence career development opportunities. 

We believe that recognizing these contributions not only motivates individuals but also reinforces our organisational commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace.

---

If you want, I can help you tailor this further to suit your organisation’s tone or add examples.",100%,"### Overview

The organisation recognises and rewards employee contributions to LGBTQ+ DE&I primarily through performance evaluation and compensation decisions, rather than through a standalone LGBTQ+-specific recognition programme.

### Mechanism of Recognition

1. **Identification of Contributions**
   - When an employee’s efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I (and broader DE&I) are observed or reported, these contributions are:
     - Noted by colleagues, managers, or other stakeholders.
     - Formally or informally documented as part of the employee’s performance.

2. **Feedback to Management**
   - The information about the employee’s DE&I support is:
     - Communicated (“fed back”) to management.
     - Taken into account alongside other performance factors, rather than treated as a separate track.

3. **Impact on Rewards**
   - These contributions are:
     - Considered within the overall performance review process.
     - Specifically factored into the determination of the **year‑end bonus**.
   - This indicates that meaningful work in LGBTQ+ DE&I can positively influence variable compensation.

### Key Features of the Approach

- **Integrated into General DE&I**: LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts are recognised within the broader DE&I agenda, not isolated as a separate category.
- **Embedded in Performance & Pay**: Recognition occurs through the core reward mechanism (year‑end bonus), reinforcing that LGBTQ+ DE&I is part of expected organisational performance.
- **Qualitative Assessment**: Recognition seems to rely on qualitative feedback and management judgment rather than on formal metrics or targets specific to LGBTQ+ DE&I.

### ESG / DE&I Implications

- **Strengths**
  - Signals that LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions have tangible consequences for reward and recognition.
  - Integrates inclusion behaviours into mainstream performance management, which can normalise them as part of good leadership and citizenship.

- **Potential Gaps / Areas to Clarify**
  - No mention of:
    - Formal criteria or guidelines for what constitutes significant LGBTQ+ DE&I contribution.
    - Dedicated awards, recognition programmes, or public acknowledgement specific to LGBTQ+ inclusion.
    - Transparent processes to ensure consistency and avoid subjectivity in how contributions are valued.

In summary, the organisation currently recognises LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts by feeding observed contributions into management evaluations and factoring them into year‑end bonus determinations, treating such efforts as an integrated element of overall DE&I and performance rather than through separate, formalised LGBTQ+-specific recognition schemes.",100%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","During the lead up to Pride month and on International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia DWS UK were part of the global campaign within the organisation to raise awareness of the hugely important topic which was supported by a member of our Executive Board in which the UK also raised the importance of allies and shared details on how individuals could get involved in the campaign or sign-up to become a regional ally.",,"In the last 12 months, proactive actions taken by both individuals and the organisation include participating in global campaigns during key observances such as Pride Month and the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia. DWS UK actively contributed to raising awareness on these important topics, with support from a member of their Executive Board. Additionally, the organisation promoted the role of allies by sharing information on how individuals could engage with the campaign and encouraging them to sign up as regional allies, thereby fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment.",100%,"**LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities – Summary of Proactive Actions (Last 12 Months)**

### 1. Organisational-Level Actions

**a. Participation in Global LGBTQ+ Campaigns**  
- DWS UK actively participated in a global, organisation-wide campaign around:
  - Pride Month  
  - International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT)  
- This aligns the UK entity with broader corporate LGBTQ+ inclusion and awareness strategies, reinforcing consistent global DE&I standards.

**b. Executive-Level Sponsorship and Visibility**  
- A member of the Executive Board publicly supported the campaign, demonstrating:
  - Visible leadership commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion.
  - Executive-level responsibility for setting a tone of respect and non-discrimination.
- This elevates LGBTQ+ DE&I from a grassroots initiative to a strategic priority supported at the highest levels.

**c. Awareness-Raising on LGBTQ+ Issues**  
- The organisation focused on increasing awareness of:
  - Homophobia, biphobia and transphobia and their impacts in the workplace and society.
  - The importance of Pride as both a celebration and a continued call for equality and safety.
- By framing the topic as “hugely important,” DWS UK positions LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion as integral to its culture and values, not as a peripheral HR topic.

### 2. Individual-Level and Allyship Responsibilities

**a. Promotion of Allyship as a Responsibility**  
- The UK entity highlighted the role and importance of allies, emphasizing that:
  - Non-LGBTQ+ employees share responsibility for fostering an inclusive environment.
  - Allyship is an active role, not a passive identity.
- This shifts responsibility from solely LGBTQ+ employees to the whole workforce.

**b. Clear Pathways for Individual Involvement**  
- Employees were given specific guidance on:
  - How to get involved in the campaign.
  - How to sign up as a regional ally.
- This turns general “support” into tangible, proactive actions expected of individuals, such as:
  - Participating in events or awareness sessions.
  - Publicly identifying as allies to provide visible support.
  - Engaging in learning and advocacy activities within their region or team.

### 3. Regional and Local Implementation

**a. Regional Ally Networks**  
- By encouraging sign-ups as “regional allies,” DWS UK:
  - Helps develop local networks of visible support across different business areas or locations.
  - Distributes responsibility for LGBTQ+ inclusion beyond central HR or DE&I teams.
- This supports more consistent, on-the-ground implementation of inclusive practices.

---

In the last 12 months, DWS UK has:  
- **Demonstrated leadership accountability** for LGBTQ+ inclusion through Executive Board involvement.  
- **Integrated global LGBTQ+ campaigns locally** around Pride and IDAHOBIT, reinforcing a unified corporate stance against discrimination.  
- **Promoted individual responsibility** by emphasizing allyship and providing clear mechanisms for employees to act (campaign participation and ally sign-up).

**1. Voluntary Disclosure Mechanism**

- The organization provides an option for employees to **voluntarily disclose their sexual orientation**.
- This disclosure is done through the **HR information system**, indicating there is a formal, structured data field for sexual orientation.

**2. Scope of Data Collected**

- The only aspect explicitly mentioned is **sexual orientation**.
- There is no detail provided on:
  - Which specific **sexual orientation categories/options** are available (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer, heterosexual, prefer not to say, self-describe, etc.).
  - Whether the system allows **multiple selections** or **self-description**.

**3. Nature of Participation**

- Disclosure is described as **voluntary**, implying:
  - Employees are not required to answer.
  - There is an option in practice to **not disclose** (even if not explicitly stated).

**4. DE&I Responsibility Implications**

- The organization has taken at least a foundational step in LGBTQ+ inclusion by:
  - Recognizing sexual orientation as a relevant employee characteristic.
  - Creating an HR-system-based mechanism to collect this information for potential DE&I monitoring, reporting, or program design.
- However, the response does **not** clarify:
  - How the data is **protected** (confidentiality, access control).
  - How the data is **used** (e.g., measuring inclusion, benefits design, targeted support).
  - Whether similar options are available for **gender identity, gender expression, or intersex status**, which are also key LGBTQ+ DE&I dimensions.

### 1. Campaign Overview  
The organization has implemented a **self-disclosure campaign** focused on increasing voluntary reporting of DE&I-related demographic data. This campaign was conducted **earlier in the year** and targeted multiple identity categories, including LGBTQ+-relevant fields.

### 2. Scope of Self-ID Categories  
The campaign sought to improve employee comfort and participation in disclosing data across the following dimensions:

- **Race/Ethnicity**  
- **Gender Identity** (relevant to trans and non-binary inclusion)  
- **Sexual Orientation** (directly relevant to LGBTQ+ representation)  
- **Disability**

By including gender identity and sexual orientation, the initiative explicitly supports better understanding and representation of LGBTQ+ employees within the workforce.

### 3. Implicit Responsibilities and Focus Areas  

While limited detail is provided on tactics, the response implies the organization has taken on the following responsibilities related to LGBTQ+ DE&I data:

- **Recognition of the importance of self-ID data**  
  - Acknowledging that accurate, voluntary demographic data (including LGBTQ+ identities) is essential to measure inclusion, representation, and equity.

- **Creating an opportunity to disclose in a structured way**  
  - Providing a defined campaign and process through which employees can disclose or update their information.

- **Normalizing LGBTQ+ and other identity disclosure**  
  - By grouping sexual orientation and gender identity alongside race/ethnicity and disability, the organization is treating LGBTQ+ identities as a standard, legitimate part of its DE&I framework.

- The **methods** used to increase comfort (e.g., education, manager training, FAQs, anonymous channels, town halls).  
- How **privacy, confidentiality, and data protection** were communicated.  
- Whether there was messaging around **why** the data is collected (e.g., to identify inequities, improve benefits, or track LGBTQ+ inclusion).  
- Any **follow-up actions** to maintain or further build trust and ongoing disclosure beyond the initial campaign period.

---

In summary, the organization has run a dedicated **self-disclosure campaign** aimed at increasing voluntary reporting of demographic data, including **gender identity and sexual orientation**, which is a core component of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility. However, the specific strategies used to build comfort, trust, and understanding around this disclosure remain unspecified.",60%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,"Diversity and Inclusion is embedded throughout our recruitment process. From making sure job descriptions and specifications are not unconsciously bias, to ensuring diverse interview panels and candidate pools, our specialist in-house recruitment team partner with the business end-to-end to ensure that diversity and inclusion is considered at every step of the process. As part of our global recruitment process, hiring managers must have a diverse candidate short list. If this is not met, it must be approved as an exception (with rationale) by our Global COO.",,"Your response effectively communicates your organisation’s commitment to diversity and inclusion in recruitment, highlighting specific measures such as unbiased job descriptions, diverse interview panels, and diverse candidate shortlists with executive oversight. To further strengthen your answer regarding targeting and attracting LGBTQ+ talent specifically, consider including details on any of the following:

- Partnerships with LGBTQ+ professional networks, job boards, or community organisations  
- Participation in LGBTQ+ career fairs or events  
- Inclusive employer branding that explicitly references support for LGBTQ+ employees  
- Employee resource groups or LGBTQ+ allies programs that promote an inclusive workplace  
- Training for recruiters and hiring managers on LGBTQ+ inclusion and biases  

Incorporating these elements can demonstrate a targeted, proactive approach to attracting LGBTQ+ talent beyond general diversity practices. If any such initiatives exist within your organisation, mentioning them will provide a clearer picture of your targeted efforts.",80%,"**Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities in Targeting and Attracting Talent**

1. **Embedding Inclusion Across the Recruitment Lifecycle**  
   - Diversity and Inclusion principles are integrated into every stage of the recruitment process (role design, sourcing, selection, and hiring decisions).  
   - The responsibility is organisation-wide, with recruitment and hiring managers expected to apply DE&I criteria as a standard, not an add-on.

2. **Bias-Aware Job Design and Advertising**  
   - Job descriptions and person specifications are reviewed to avoid unconscious bias in language, criteria, and framing.  
   - This aims to make roles more accessible and appealing to underrepresented groups, including LGBTQ+ candidates.

3. **Specialist In-House Recruitment Function**  
   - A dedicated in-house recruitment team partners with business units end-to-end on hiring.  
   - This team is responsible for ensuring that DE&I commitments are applied consistently and that recruitment practices remain inclusive for LGBTQ+ and other diverse candidates.

4. **Diverse Candidate Pools and Shortlists**  
   - Hiring managers are required to have diverse candidate shortlists as part of the global recruitment process.  
   - This creates an institutional expectation that underrepresented groups, implicitly including LGBTQ+ talent, are actively considered for roles.

5. **Diverse Interview Panels**  
   - Interview panels are deliberately composed to be diverse.  
   - This reduces the risk of homogenous decision-making and can help LGBTQ+ candidates feel more represented and comfortable during assessment.

6. **Governance and Accountability (Escalation to Global COO)**  
   - If a diverse shortlist cannot be achieved, an exception must be formally approved by the Global COO, including a rationale.  
   - This high-level oversight embeds accountability for inclusive hiring outcomes at senior executive level, reinforcing that diversity (including LGBTQ+ inclusion) is a strategic priority rather than a discretionary practice.

**Scope and Limitations in the LGBTQ+ Context**

- The response describes **structural, process-based inclusion measures** that benefit LGBTQ+ candidates indirectly (through bias reduction and enforced diversity).  
- It does **not explicitly reference LGBTQ+-specific outreach**, employer branding, partnerships (e.g., with LGBTQ+ professional networks), or measurement of LGBTQ+ representation.  
- As framed, the organisation’s responsibilities are:  
  - To systematically reduce bias in recruitment,  
  - To require diverse candidate representation and interviewers, and  
  - To enforce these expectations via executive-level approval processes.",70%,46ef82a559454c6ca1181e78b607dfa0,How does your organisation seek to position itself as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer?,"Wording included on our JDs: We promote good working relationships and encourage high standards of conduct and work performance.

Here's a suggested revision:

---

For each of the selected stakeholder groups referenced in Q3, we do not measure DE&I performance separately by specific areas or constituencies. Instead, all leaders have performance objectives that include DE&I goals, which are evaluated holistically as part of their overall performance ratings. Each stakeholder group is assessed through various metrics aligned with their respective functions and roles, ensuring that DE&I considerations are integrated appropriately across the organization.

Regarding the use of individual names, we confirm that we have obtained permission from all referenced persons before including their names in any materials.

---

Would you like assistance tailoring this further based on particular stakeholder groups or additional context?",100%,"Below is a structured ESG-style summary of the organization’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and measurement approach, based on the employee response.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Groups and Scope

The respondent indicates that the organization does **not** assess DE&I performance “based on any specific area/constituency.” This implies:

- No distinct LGBTQ+-specific targets or KPIs are broken out **by stakeholder group** (e.g., individual departments, locations, or specific employee cohorts).
- DE&I, including LGBTQ+ inclusion, is treated as a **cross-cutting responsibility** that applies broadly across the organization.

Stakeholder groups (such as leaders, functional teams, or other internal groups) are therefore **not individually measured** against separate LGBTQ+ DE&I metrics, but are encompassed within a holistic framework.

---

## 2. Leadership Responsibilities for LGBTQ+ DE&I

**Who they are:**  
“All leaders” are identified as a key stakeholder group. This generally includes:

- Senior executives
- People managers
- Functional and departmental leaders

**How they are measured:**  

- **Performance Objectives:** Every leader has performance objectives that explicitly include **DE&I**, which by implication covers LGBTQ+ inclusion alongside other dimensions of diversity and equity.
- **Holistic Evaluation:** These DE&I objectives are **not isolated** in a standalone DE&I scorecard. Instead, they are “measured holistically within their overall performance rating.”
  - DE&I performance is integrated into the broader assessment of leadership performance (e.g., leadership behaviors, culture-building, people management).
  - Success or underperformance on DE&I responsibilities (which would include fostering an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ employees) contributes to the overall performance outcome, but is **not disaggregated** as a separate LGBTQ+-specific metric.

This approach positions LGBTQ+ DE&I as an **embedded leadership accountability**, rather than a siloed or standalone initiative.

---

## 3. Other Internal Groups and Functions

**Who they are:**  
The response notes: “Each group is assessed in various ways based on their function/role.” This suggests that:

- Different business functions (e.g., HR, Operations, Sales, Compliance) and roles have **tailored performance measures**, aligned with their responsibilities.
- These groups may **influence DE&I outcomes** (including LGBTQ+ inclusion) through hiring practices, policies, culture, training, and employee support mechanisms.

**How they are measured:**  

- **Function-Specific Assessment:** Each group is evaluated using metrics and criteria relevant to its function (e.g., HR on talent processes, managers on team engagement, etc.).
- **Implicit DE&I Dimension:** While not explicitly broken out as LGBTQ+-specific indicators, DE&I outcomes and behaviors are likely reflected in:
  - People management practices
  - Team climate and engagement
  - Implementation of inclusive policies and initiatives
- There is **no indication** of:
  - Separate LGBTQ+ representation targets per function
  - Function-level LGBTQ+-specific engagement or inclusion indices
  - Named individuals being assessed in a public or reportable manner

---

## 4. Use of Individual Names and Consent

The response **does not reference any specific person by name**. As such:

- No named individual is used as an example of LGBTQ+ DE&I performance.
- No permission is needed or implied for the use of personal names in this context.

If the organization were to cite a specific leader or employee in future disclosures, it would then need to confirm that it has the individual’s **permission to use their name**, especially where it might imply or reveal aspects of identity or performance.

---

## 5. Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Measurement Approach

- **No constituency-specific DE&I scoring:** The organization does **not** segment DE&I performance measurement by a particular DE&I category or specific stakeholder subgroup (including LGBTQ+).
- **Leadership accountability:** All leaders hold integrated DE&I objectives that form part of their **overall performance rating**, framing LGBTQ+ DE&I as a core aspect of leadership effectiveness.
- **Role-based assessment:** Each group or function is assessed in ways aligned with its **role and responsibilities**, but not through explicit, standalone LGBTQ+ metrics.
- **Privacy and consent:** No individuals are named; thus, no consent for name usage is implicated in this response.

This reflects a model where LGBTQ+ DE&I is **embedded in broad DE&I and leadership expectations**, rather than tracked and reported through discrete LGBTQ+-specific KPIs by stakeholder group.",60%,0e5cee8da6d243ed8d4c091a6d8bbff5,How does your organisation recognise and reward employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"Employees are recognized in various ways - Team recognition, email from senior management, performance appraisal, featured in firm communications on leadership (How I Lead Series) and firm culture etc.","Evidence of formal and informal rewards and recognition process for employees.

To enhance clarity and impact, you might consider elaborating slightly on how these recognition methods specifically support LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts. For example:

---

Our organization recognizes and rewards employees who actively support LGBTQ+ Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) through multiple channels. This includes team acknowledgments during meetings, personalized emails from senior management highlighting their contributions, and incorporation of their efforts into performance appraisals. Additionally, employees are featured in firm-wide communications such as the ""How I Lead"" series, showcasing their leadership in fostering an inclusive culture. These recognition initiatives not only celebrate individual achievements but also reinforce our commitment to creating a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ colleagues.

  - Leadership-focused content (e.g., *“How I Lead”* series)  
  - Firm culture spotlights
- These features raise the internal profile of employees who champion LGBTQ+ inclusion and position them as role models and culture carriers.

Based on the employee response, the organization has established structured self-identification fields within its HR system (Workday) for U.S. employees. This reflects a deliberate approach to LGBTQ+ inclusion, data visibility, and respect for individual identity and privacy.

#### 1. Scope and System

- **Platform:** Workday (HR information system)  
- **Coverage:** All U.S.-based employees  
- **Purpose (implied):** Enable employees to self-identify across multiple dimensions of gender and sexual orientation, supporting DE&I analytics, inclusive policies, and tailored benefits/engagement.

---

#### 2. Sexual Orientation

Employees are invited to disclose their sexual orientation from a spectrum of identities. The options include:

- **Asexual**
- **Bisexual**
- **Gay**
- **Lesbian**
- **Pansexual**
- **Queer**
- **Straight / Heterosexual**
- **Prefer not to answer**

**DE&I significance:**

- Recognizes a broad set of sexual orientations beyond a simple gay/straight binary.
- Includes **Asexual** and **Pansexual**, which are often omitted, indicating a more nuanced understanding of LGBTQ+ identities.
- Uses **“Queer”** as an available identity label, reflecting reclamation of the term by many in the community.
- The **“Prefer not to answer”** option respects employee privacy and ensures participation is voluntary rather than coerced.

---

#### 3. Gender Identity

Separate from gender/sex markers, the organization provides explicit options for gender identity:

- **Female**
- **Male**
- **Non-Binary**
- **Transgender Female**
- **Transgender Male**
- **Prefer not to answer**

**DE&I significance:**

- Distinguishes between **cisgender and transgender identities** by providing:
  - “Transgender Female”
  - “Transgender Male”
- Includes **“Non-Binary”**, acknowledging identities outside the traditional male/female binary.
- **“Female”** and **“Male”** remain available, likely functioning as cisgender identity options for those who identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.
- **“Prefer not to answer”** again safeguards employee autonomy and privacy.

---

#### 4. Key LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities Reflected

From an ESG and DE&I perspective, this setup indicates the following organizational responsibilities are being addressed:

1. **Recognition and Inclusion of Diverse Identities**
   - Acknowledges multiple LGBTQ+ orientations and gender identities rather than limiting data to minimal categories.
   - Supports visibility for transgender and non-binary employees, who are often underrepresented or misclassified in HR systems.

2. **Respect for Privacy and Voluntariness**
   - “Prefer not to answer” options for both sexual orientation and gender identity demonstrate that disclosure is **optional**, which is a critical DE&I norm and a good practice for compliance and trust.

3. **Data Infrastructure for Equity Monitoring**
   - By capturing structured data on LGBTQ+ identities, the company is better positioned to:
     - Monitor representation and equity (hiring, promotion, pay, retention).
     - Assess inclusion outcomes for LGBTQ+ employees.
     - Design targeted support (benefits, policies, ERGs, training).

4. **Alignment with Inclusive HR Standards**
   - Use of a mainstream HR system (Workday) to support expanded identity categories indicates:
     - Integration of DE&I in core HR processes rather than in separate or ad hoc tools.
     - Potential alignment with leading practices and ESG expectations around LGBTQ+ data visibility.

---

#### 5. Areas Not Explicitly Addressed (but implied needs)

While the response describes what is collected, effective LGBTQ+ DE&I practice also requires:

- **Clear communication** that this data is:
  - Voluntary and confidential.
  - Used for DE&I and compliance, not for adverse decisions.
- **Governance and safeguards**:
  - Data privacy, access controls, and non-discrimination commitments.
- **Complementary policies and programs**:
  - Anti-discrimination and anti-harassment protections inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity.
  - LGBTQ+-inclusive benefits and employee resource groups.

These elements are not specified in the response, but they are typically expected to accompany such data collection within an ESG/DE&I framework.

---

### Summary

The organization enables U.S. employees to self-identify their **sexual orientation** (including a wide LGBTQ+ spectrum and “Prefer not to answer”) and **gender identity** (including transgender and non-binary categories, plus “Prefer not to answer”) in Workday.

We regularly leverage our internal communication channels to encourage employees to share their self-ID information for DE&I purposes. For example, in December, we launched a video series featuring senior leaders, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and Allies who emphasize the importance of self-ID disclosure. These videos aim to foster an inclusive environment where employees feel comfortable sharing their identities. Additionally, we provide ongoing reminders and information about data privacy and confidentiality to build trust around the process. We also facilitate interactive sessions where employees can ask questions and share their experiences, helping to address any concerns. These approaches have contributed to increasing awareness and comfort around self-ID disclosure within our organisation.

The employee’s response lists three recognitions that, while not all LGBTQ+-specific, collectively indicate a structured commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I), including LGBTQ+ inclusion:

1. **Seramount – 100 Best Companies**  
   - This award generally recognizes organizations with strong inclusive workplace practices, including policies and benefits that support diverse employees (such as inclusive parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and family benefits that typically extend to LGBTQ+ families).  
   - It implies responsibility for maintaining inclusive HR policies, fair talent practices, and equitable career development for all employees, including LGBTQ+ staff.

2. **Disability Equality Index (DEI)**  
   - The Disability Equality Index measures disability inclusion; organizations that participate and score highly demonstrate a structured approach to accessibility, inclusive hiring, and accommodations.  
   - While focused on disability, it reflects broader responsibility for intersectional DE&I—supporting employees who may be both LGBTQ+ and disabled, ensuring policies and workplace culture are inclusive across multiple identities.

3. **Human Rights Campaign – Corporate Equality Index (90% Score)**  
   - A 90% score on HRC’s Corporate Equality Index indicates the company has implemented most of the key standards for LGBTQ+ workplace equality. This typically includes:  
     - Explicit non-discrimination policies that cover sexual orientation and gender identity.  
     - Equitable benefits for LGBTQ+ employees and their families.  
     - Transgender-inclusive health coverage and policies.

The M&G inclusion index is cascaded from Exec Management to each people manager with a team of more than 10 people to be able to track year on year improvement of colleague inclusion within their respective teams. The inclusion index is analysed across many aspects of diversity including LGBT+ to ensure there is no significant difference in treatment of the feeling of inclusion of colleagues.

**Mechanism:**
- All employees have the option (not obligation) to self‑identify their sexual orientation within the company’s HR system.

**Question Asked:**
- The system asks employees to indicate their sexual orientation (phrasing implied rather than explicitly given, but clearly focused on sexual orientation identity).

**Response Options Provided:**
Employees can choose from the following categories:
1. **Heterosexual / Straight**  
2. **Gay Man**

---

We have an ongoing colleague campaign that encourages employees to review and update their diversity data to ensure it is accurate and reflects how they wish to be identified. This campaign is supported by clear communication about the importance of self-ID data in driving our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. We also provide reassurances about data confidentiality and use, creating a safe and trusting environment that helps colleagues feel comfortable sharing personal information. Additionally, we offer multiple channels (e.g., anonymous options, one-on-one support) to make the disclosure process as accessible and comfortable as possible.

---

If you want, I can help you tailor this further based on your organisation's specific practices.",100%,"**Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities Related to Self‑ID Disclosure**

1. **Active Campaign to Improve Data Accuracy and Inclusiveness**  
   - The organisation is running an ongoing colleague-facing campaign specifically focused on diversity data.  
   - Core message: colleagues are encouraged to review their personal diversity information and ensure it is *true, correct, and aligned with how they wish to be identified*.  
   - This indicates a recognition that identity (including LGBTQ+ identity) is personal and may change over time, and that systems must reflect current self-identification rather than static or assumed data.

2. **Respect for Self-Identification and Personal Autonomy**  
   - The emphasis on “reflects how they wish to be identified” signals a commitment to:  
     - Voluntary self-identification.  
     - Respecting each person’s chosen labels and categories (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity, trans status, non-binary identities).  
   - This supports LGBTQ+ inclusion by acknowledging that individuals are the sole authority on their identity, not HR systems or managers.

3. **Normalisation of DE&I Data Updates**  
   - By making the campaign ongoing rather than a one-off exercise, the organisation:  
     - Helps normalise the idea that updating self‑ID data is routine and acceptable.  
     - Reduces stigma or fear that updating LGBTQ+‑related fields is unusual or will draw attention.  
   - This ongoing approach can help increase comfort and trust over time, which is essential for more accurate LGBTQ+ data.

4. **Data Quality as a DE&I Responsibility**  
   - The organisation links accurate data with better DE&I outcomes:  
     - Accurate self‑ID data enables more precise monitoring of LGBTQ+ representation, pay, progression, and inclusion.  
     - It shows an understanding that reliable DE&I metrics depend on people feeling safe and empowered to disclose.  

5. **Implied Responsibility for Inclusive Systems and Communications**  
   - While not fully detailed in the response, the campaign implies responsibility to:  
     - Maintain HR and people systems that offer inclusive categories (e.g., inclusive gender options, multiple sexual orientation options, “prefer to self‑describe,” “prefer not to say”).  
     - Communicate clearly why data is collected, how it is used, and how privacy is protected—key to building LGBTQ+ employees’ confidence in disclosing.  

**Overall Assessment**

The organisation’s primary strategy to improve comfort around disclosing self‑ID DE&I data—particularly relevant for LGBTQ+ colleagues—is an *ongoing awareness and encouragement campaign* focused on accurate, self-determined diversity data. This reflects responsibilities to:

- Respect self-identification and personal agency.  
- Normalise updating and disclosing identity data over time.  
- Improve DE&I insight and accountability through better data quality.  

To strengthen this further, the organisation could explicitly communicate safeguards (confidentiality, anonymisation, purpose of data use) and ensure system options are fully inclusive for all LGBTQ+ identities.",60%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,"The following wording is included in all of our job adverts (which use inclusive, gender- neutral language), aimed at attracting a diverse talent pool: ""We have a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture at M&G plc, underpinned by our policies and our employee-led networks who provide networking opportunities, advice and support for the diverse communities our colleagues represent.

- **Policy & Culture Signalling**: Clearly communicating a commitment to inclusion of sexual orientation and gender diversity in all job adverts.
- **Inclusive Communication**: Using gender-neutral language and inclusive framing to reduce bias and foster psychological safety for LGBTQ+ applicants.
- **Supportive Infrastructure**: Promoting the existence of employee-led networks and inclusive policies to demonstrate tangible internal support for LGBTQ+ employees.

We ask that you consider the expectations of our customers, colleagues, or partners that you will be interacting with on each working day as well as considering if you are working from an M&G office or your home.

And if you’re already a parent, there are other types of family leave available too.

     - A recurring internal newsletter, “Pride@Man,” is used to spotlight LGBTQ+ role models and allies.  
     - The newsletter format ensures a consistent, structured touchpoint for LGBTQ+ DE&I topics, updates, and recognition.

3. **Culture and Community-Building**
   - By celebrating role models and allies, the company fosters a culture of recognition, belonging, and psychological safety for LGBTQ+ employees.
   - Highlighting allies signals that inclusion is a shared responsibility, not limited to those who identify as LGBTQ+.

4. **Ongoing Engagement**
   - The monthly cadence of the Pride@Man newsletter indicates an ongoing commitment rather than one-off or purely event-based (e.g., Pride Month only) activity.
   - Regular Slack engagement helps maintain continuous visibility and dialogue around LGBTQ+ inclusion.

1. **Process Description**  
   - The organization conducts an **annual staff survey**.

   - The results are **monitored and analyzed** to identify themes, concerns, and areas for improvement.  
   - **Feedback from the survey is then delivered** to the relevant internal groups and individuals so they can consider and act on the findings (e.g., team leaders, department heads, or functional owners).

   - The **People Team** (typically HR or a similar function) is the primary stakeholder accountable for:  
     - Managing and administering the annual staff survey.  
     - Monitoring and reviewing survey responses and data.  
     - Ensuring that the resulting feedback is communicated to the appropriate groups and individuals for follow‑up actions.

- **Clear Communication on Data Use and Privacy:** Regularly share transparent information regarding how the DE&I data is used, stored, and protected, emphasizing confidentiality and the benefits of disclosure.

- **Leadership Endorsement:** Encourage leaders to openly discuss the importance of DE&I data and, where appropriate, share their own self-ID information to model trust and openness.

- **Employee Education Sessions:** Offer workshops or informational sessions explaining the purpose of self-ID data collection and how it contributes to creating a more inclusive workplace.

- **Incentivization and Recognition:** Create recognition programs that highlight the positive impacts of increased disclosure on DE&I initiatives, reinforcing collective progress.

- **Integrate DE&I into Organisational Values:** Ensure that the importance of DE&I data disclosure is visibly embedded in company values and day-to-day practices.

These approaches, alongside your People team’s regular updates highlighting current disclosure levels, can help build a culture where employees feel more comfortable and motivated to share their self-ID information.",100%,"**Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities Related to Self‑ID Disclosure**

1. **Data Transparency and Feedback Loops**  
   - The organisation’s People team regularly shares updates with business units on the diversity data currently disclosed by employees.  
   - These updates make visible what information is available (and, by implication, where there are gaps) at a business unit level.

2. **Encouraging Voluntary Self‑Identification**  
   - By showing each unit what diversity information has been provided, the organisation is using transparency as a nudge to increase participation in self‑ID.  
   - The approach is intended to normalise disclosure and highlight the importance of complete DE&I data for understanding workforce demographics, including LGBTQ+ representation.

3. **Responsibility for Ongoing Engagement**  
   - The People team holds responsibility for maintaining regular communication about DE&I data status.  
   - This indicates an ongoing, structured process rather than a one‑off campaign, suggesting continued stewardship over the quality and completeness of self‑ID DE&I data.

4. **Implied Focus on Accountability and Ownership**  
   - Providing business unit–level updates encourages local leaders to take ownership of their DE&I data and to support a culture where employees feel comfortable disclosing.  
   - While not explicitly stated, this approach aligns with creating internal accountability for improving self‑ID rates.

5. **Gaps / Unstated Elements**  
   - No specific education, training, or communication campaigns about privacy, data security, or the benefits of self‑ID are mentioned.  
   - There is no explicit reference to LGBTQ+‑specific messaging, ERG involvement, or targeted reassurance for sensitive identities.

Would you like me to help you further tailor it for specific use cases or add any additional details?",100%,"**LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities – Targeting and Attracting LGBTQ+ Talent**

1. **Overall Commitment to Inclusion**  
   - The organisation states a broad commitment to **diversity and inclusion**, with an emphasis on:
     - Celebrating difference in the workplace.  
     - Ensuring **equal opportunity to thrive** for all employees, including LGBTQ+ staff.  
     - “Giving back” and **contributing positively to communities**, which implies a responsibility to support underrepresented groups beyond the workplace.

2. **Approach to Recruitment Targets and Quotas**  
   - The organisation **does not set specific quotas or numerical targets** for recruiting LGBTQ+ (or other diverse) candidates.  
   - This indicates a focus on **equal opportunity** and inclusive practices rather than **positive discrimination** or mandated representation levels.  
   - Responsibility is framed around **fair, inclusive processes** rather than outcome-based metrics.

3. **Targeted Attraction of LGBTQ+ Talent**  
   The organisation takes some **practical steps** to reach LGBTQ+ candidates:

   - **Use of LGBT Great Job Board**  
     - The organisation uses the **LGBT Great** job board, which is a specialist platform aimed at LGBTQ+ professionals.  
     - This is a **proactive measure** to reach LGBTQ+ talent pools and signal that LGBTQ+ candidates are welcome and valued.  
     - Responsibility here includes:
       - Making roles visible in LGBTQ+-focused spaces.  
       - Publicly aligning recruitment channels with LGBTQ+ inclusion.

   - **Partnerships with Diverse Recruitment Agencies**  
     - The organisation **works with diverse recruitment partners**, implying that its recruitment supply chain includes agencies with a DE&I focus.  
     - Through these partners, the organisation aims to attract candidates from a **broad spectrum of backgrounds**, which would include LGBTQ+ individuals.  
     - This shows responsibility for:
       - Embedding DE&I expectations in external recruitment relationships.  
       - Leveraging specialist expertise to ensure more inclusive candidate sourcing.

4. **Implied Organisational Responsibilities**  
   From the response, the organisation’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities in this area can be summarised as:

   - **Creating an inclusive environment** in which LGBTQ+ employees can “thrive,” not just be hired.  
   - **Avoiding discriminatory barriers** in recruitment while also not adopting hard quotas.  
   - **Using inclusive channels** (e.g., LGBT Great job board) to reach LGBTQ+ candidates.  
   - **Partnering with diverse-focused recruiters** to widen access and representation in applicant pools.  
   - **Contributing positively to communities**, which indicates a responsibility beyond compliance—aligning recruitment and employer branding with broader social inclusion goals.

5. **Areas Potentially Not Addressed (for context)**  
   While the response demonstrates some responsibility for attracting LGBTQ+ talent, it does **not explicitly mention**:
   - Structured LGBTQ+ recruitment programs, internships, or pipelines.  
   - LGBTQ+-specific employer branding (e.g., visible LGBTQ+ role models, benefits, or policies).  
   - Measurement of LGBTQ+ representation or recruitment outcomes.  

   These are not claimed responsibilities in the answer and would be areas for further development if the organisation wished to strengthen its LGBTQ+ DE&I strategy.

**Summary**  
The organisation assumes responsibility for attracting LGBTQ+ talent primarily through **inclusive values, LGBTQ+-specific job advertising (LGBT Great), and diverse recruitment partnerships**, while deliberately avoiding recruitment quotas.

### Reported Response
- **Employee response:** “TBC” (To Be Confirmed)

### Interpretation
- The organization has **not yet provided specific information** or a confirmed list of awards related to LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion.
- “TBC” suggests that:
  - Relevant DE&I recognitions may **exist but are not finalized or collated** for reporting, or  
  - The organization has **no current awards** to report and is leaving this open pending future developments or verification.

### ESG / DE&I Implications
- **Transparency gap:** The lack of a concrete answer limits insight into external validation of the company’s LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts.
- **Next-step responsibility:**
  - Clarify whether any LGBTQ+-specific or broader DE&I awards have been:
    - Received (with year, awarding body, and scope),
    - Nominated/shortlisted,
    - Applied for but pending.
  - Once confirmed, document these awards in a consistent format (award name, issuing organization, date, and relevance to LGBTQ+ inclusion).

### Recommended Disclosures (When Available)
When the “TBC” is resolved, the organization should be prepared to disclose:
1. **Award name and issuing body** (e.g., Stonewall, HRC, national DE&I indices).
2. **Year(s) received** and whether it is a one-off or recurring recognition.
3. **Scope and coverage** (LGBTQ+-specific vs. broader DE&I, geography, employee size category).
4. **Key criteria** that demonstrate LGBTQ+ DE&I performance (e.g., inclusive benefits, non-discrimination policies, employee resource groups, training, leadership accountability).

That way, I can help describe their responsibilities for LGBTQ+ DE&I in your organisation.",0%,"Below is a structured summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities **based on the information actually provided** in the response.

---

## 1. Clarity of the Response

The reply given is:

> “For each of the selected answers in Q1, please describe what responsibilities they have for LGBTQ+ DE&I in your organisation.”

This is a repetition of the question itself, not a description of any people, roles, or responsibilities.  
**No specific roles, functions, or actions are identified**, so we cannot map or summarise actual responsibilities within the organisation from this response.

---

## 2. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility Mapping

Because the response is empty of substantive detail:

- **No individuals or groups are named** (e.g., HR, senior leadership, ERGs, line managers).
- **No responsibilities are described** (e.g., policy setting, training, reporting, support mechanisms).
- **No structure or governance is evident** (e.g., committees, sponsors, working groups).

From an ESG and DE&I analysis standpoint, this means:

- The organisation’s **allocation of responsibility for LGBTQ+ DE&I cannot be assessed** from the given answer.
- It is **not possible to determine** whether responsibilities are:
  - Centralised (e.g., held mainly by HR or a DE&I office),
  - Distributed (e.g., shared among leaders, managers, and ERGs),
  - Or largely informal / undefined.

---

## 3. What Would Be Needed for a Proper Responsibility Summary

To generate a meaningful, structured summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities, the organisation would need to specify, for each role selected in Q1 (such as):

- **Board / Executive Leadership**
  - Example responsibilities: setting overall DE&I vision and goals; approving LGBTQ+ policies; overseeing progress and risk management.

- **HR / People Team**
  - Example responsibilities: inclusive recruitment and benefits; anti-discrimination policies; grievance procedures; data collection and reporting.

- **DE&I or ESG Team**
  - Example responsibilities: designing strategy; coordinating initiatives; monitoring metrics; stakeholder engagement.

- **Line Managers**
  - Example responsibilities: creating inclusive team cultures; handling issues; implementing policies at team level.

- **LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG) / Network**
  - Example responsibilities: peer support; advising on policies; raising awareness; providing feedback channels.

- **All Employees**
  - Example responsibilities: adhering to policies; respectful behaviour; participating in training; calling out discrimination.

Once such detail is provided, it can be translated into a clear, role‑by‑role responsibility map.

---

## 4. Recommended Next Step

To enable a proper ESG/LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility summary, the organisation should:

1. **Re-answer the question** by listing each role or group selected in Q1.
2. **Describe concretely** what each one is expected or mandated to do regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion (policies, actions, oversight, support, measurement, communication, etc.).

After that information is provided, a detailed, well-structured summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities can be produced.",0%,35cc2d603789460ca6a7860e603cf021,"For each of the selected stakeholder groups in Q3, please describe who they are and how they are measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and objectives.

Based on the employee’s response, there is **no clear information** provided on how the organisation recognises or rewards employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). The answer simply repeats the question and does not describe any practices, programmes, or mechanisms.

### 1. Stated Practices
- **None described.**  
  The response does not mention:
  - Any formal recognition schemes (e.g., awards, spotlight features, performance review criteria).
  - Any informal recognition (e.g., manager acknowledgements, team shout-outs).
  - Any material rewards (e.g., bonuses, promotions, development opportunities linked to LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions).

### 2. Clarity and Transparency
- **Lack of detail suggests one of two possibilities:**
  - Either there are **no structured recognition or reward mechanisms** for LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions; or
  - The respondent is **not aware** of any such mechanisms, indicating a potential gap in communication and transparency.

### 3. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I
- **Limited evidence of incentivisation:**  
  Without identifiable recognition or reward systems, employees may not see LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts as valued or prioritised by the organisation.
- **Potential cultural signal:**  
  The absence (or invisibility) of recognition practices can signal that LGBTQ+ inclusion work is optional, unpaid “extra” effort rather than an integrated performance expectation.

### 4. Areas for Development (Implied)
While not explicitly requested, the response points to potential improvement areas:
- Define and communicate clear ways to recognise LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions (formal and informal).
- Integrate LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts into performance evaluations and leadership expectations.
- Make recognition visible (internal communications, awards, role-modelling by leadership) so employees understand that these efforts are valued.

The organisation’s approach to recognising and rewarding LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts is **unclear and undocumented in this response**, indicating either an absence of structured practices or a lack of awareness and communication about them.",0%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.",,It looks like you’ve repeated the question instead of providing the details about the proactive actions taken in the last 12 months.

---

## 1. Existence of a Defined Process

- The response given **repeats the question verbatim** and does **not** describe:
  - Any specific LGBTQ+ DE&I process, policy, or initiative.
  - Any mechanisms for implementation, monitoring, or review.
- As a result, based on the information provided, it is **not possible to confirm**:
  - Whether a formal LGBTQ+ DE&I process exists.
  - How such a process would operate if it does exist.

---

## 2. Identification of Stakeholder Accountability

- The response **does not identify any stakeholder** who is accountable for:
  - LGBTQ+ inclusion and protection in the workplace.
  - Oversight of DE&I programs, reporting, or grievance mechanisms.
- No roles or titles (e.g., HR, DE&I lead, Executive sponsor, Board committee) are mentioned.
- Therefore, from this response alone, **no accountable person or function can be determined**.

---

## 3. Clarity, Governance, and Permissions

- The question explicitly asks that the respondent:
  - Provide details of the process, and  
  - Confirm they have permission to use any named individual’s name.
- The response:
  - Does **not** provide any details about permissions.
  - Does **not** reference any individual or confirm consent.
- This indicates that **governance, roles, and consent around LGBTQ+ DE&I are not evidenced** in the answer.

---

## 4. ESG Assessment Implications (LGBTQ+ DE&I)

From an ESG and DE&I perspective, based solely on the response:

- **Policy & Process Transparency:**  
  - No visible process for LGBTQ+ DE&I is described.
  - No evidence of documented procedures, escalation paths, or support systems.

- **Accountability & Ownership:**  
  - No indication of who in the organization is responsible for LGBTQ+ DE&I.
  - Lack of named governance structures (e.g., committee, senior sponsor, HR lead).

- **Data Reliability & Completeness:**  
  - The answer appears to be incomplete or a placeholder.
  - Additional information from the organization would be required to make any substantive ESG evaluation of LGBTQ+ DE&I practices.

---

## 5. Summary

- **Process for LGBTQ+ DE&I:** Not described.
- **Responsible Stakeholder(s):** Not identified.
- **Consent to Use Names:** Not addressed.
- **Overall ESG Clarity on LGBTQ+ DE&I:** Insufficient information; the response does not provide the detail needed to assess roles, responsibilities, or the robustness of LGBTQ+ DE&I governance.",100%,1df43bacfe2640748b1bf654f107a417,"For each of the selected options in Q6, please list the policy and provide supporting commentary.

### 1. Clarity of Response
The provided employee response is:

> “Test prfill”

This appears to be a placeholder or test entry rather than a substantive description of LGBTQ+ DE&I data collection practices.

### 2. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities

Based on this response:

- **Questions Asked:**  
  - No specific questions are described (e.g., no mention of questions on sexual orientation, gender identity, pronouns, gender expression, or other diversity attributes).

- **Answer Options Available to Employees:**  
  - No options are detailed (e.g., no list of response categories, “prefer not to say” options, or inclusive answer choices).

- **Process Transparency:**  
  - The response does not explain how questions are framed, whether participation is voluntary, whether data are anonymized, or how information is used to support LGBTQ+ inclusion.

- **Compliance and Best Practice Alignment:**  
  - With only a test placeholder provided, it is not possible to assess alignment with DE&I or privacy best practices (such as inclusive wording, respect for self-identification, or compliance with local regulations).

### 3. Assessment of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility Coverage

From an ESG and DE&I standpoint, the current response:

- **Does not demonstrate**:
  - Clear LGBTQ+-inclusive data collection.
  - Evidence of careful design of questions and response options.
  - Any mechanism to protect employee privacy or ensure voluntary disclosure.

- **Is insufficient** to:
  - Evaluate the organization’s actual LGBTQ+ DE&I practices.
  - Confirm whether the company is responsibly collecting and using demographic data to advance equity and inclusion.

### 4. Recommended Next Steps (for a Complete Answer)

To meet LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility expectations, the organization would need to specify, at minimum:

1. **What is being asked**  
   - Examples: sexual orientation, gender identity, sex assigned at birth (if relevant and legally permissible), pronouns, etc.

2. **How questions are phrased**  
   - Inclusive, non-assumptive wording; option to skip questions.

3. **What answer options exist**  
   - Multiple inclusive categories (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer, straight, questioning, “prefer to self-describe,” “prefer not to say”; woman, man, non-binary, genderqueer, etc.).

4. **Employee control and privacy**  
   - Confirmation that responses are voluntary, confidential, potentially anonymized, and used only for DE&I purposes.

The board is also involved in implementing inclusion strategies through the Moody's Diversity Council, which consists of senior leaders. This council ensures that strategic priorities are actualized with checks and balances instituted by a global executive council and regional councils in EMEA. Moreover, the board's involvement extends to supporting significant milestones such as earning a 100% from the Human Rights Campaign on its Corporate Equality Index since 2013 and being recognized as a top employer for LGBTQ+ people The Executive Leadership Team and senior leaders are involved in setting and agreeing on the LGBTQ+ inclusion strategy yearly through the strategic planning process. They are expected to demonstrate how they have increased inclusion in their teams as part of their performance management. The People Team and the Inclusion Team develop, govern, and execute the Inclusion strategy for Moody's in partnership with BRGs, leadership, Global and Regional Executive Sponsors, and every Moody's employee. They are entrusted with ensuring every person at the company feels valued and accepted. The Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are dedicated to supporting and advocating for employees from various backgrounds, including LGBTQ+ employees. They provide forums, resources, and programming to promote understanding and allyship. The Pride BRG’s mission is to advocate a work environment that respects, welcomes and supports lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and non-binary individuals, and enables them to perform to their fullest potential as well as continuing to promote the concept of being an ally. All employees are encouraged to promote an inclusive workplace culture on their teams, participate in Inclusion initiatives/BRG events..",,"The responsibilities for LGBTQ+ DE&I at Moody's are shared among several groups and roles:

- **Moody's Board**: Recognizes and supports the Pride Business Resource Group (BRG); implements inclusion strategies via the Diversity Council; oversees strategic priorities through global and regional executive councils; supports milestones like achieving a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index; and helps maintain recognition as a top employer for LGBTQ+ individuals.

- **Executive Leadership Team and Senior Leaders**: Participate in setting the LGBTQ+ inclusion strategy annually during strategic planning; incorporate inclusion goals into performance management by demonstrating increased inclusion within their teams.

- **People Team and Inclusion Team**: Develop, govern, and execute the overall Inclusion strategy in partnership with BRGs, leadership, and executive sponsors; ensure that all employees feel valued and accepted.

- **Business Resource Groups (BRGs)**, especially the Pride BRG: Advocate for LGBTQ+ employees by providing forums, resources, and programming; promote understanding, allyship, and a respectful, welcoming environment where LGBTQ+ individuals can perform to their fullest potential.

Please confirm that you have the permission of the person referenced to use their name.","Moody's measures its LGBTQ+ inclusion progress using the Inclusion Scorecard, which is a comprehensive tool designed to track and measure the company's diversity and inclusion efforts. The scorecard includes various objectives and key results measures that are aligned with the company's strategic priorities. For instance, one of the objectives is to ensure that 85% of open positions will have a diverse slate of candidates for the first round of interviews. This is a new measure introduced to track the progress of inclusion in the hiring process. The scorecard also includes measures for the success and growth of women, empowering Business Resource Groups (BRGs) to champion the culture of inclusion, and the implementation of inclusive benefits like the Global, Gender-Neutral Parental Leave policy. The Inclusion Scorecard is connected to individual and team objectives through Moody's Grow, Perform, Succeed (GPS) objective-setting and development planning performance management approach. Employees are encouraged to work with their manager to connect their individual and team objectives to the company's strategic and operational objectives outlined on the Corporate Scorecard. The TIDE programme (Talent, Inclusion, Diversity, and Equality) likely contributes to the Inclusion Scorecard by supporting the company's commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. The specific goals and objectives of the TIDE programme would align with the broader DE&I strategy and be reviewed annually to measure progress. Overall, the Inclusion Scorecard serves as an ""internal benchmark"" to hold all stakeholders accountable for shared priorities and outcomes related to LGBTQ+ inclusion and broader diversity and inclusion goals.","Evidence of a broad, robust and formalised process in place for measuring and assessing stakeholders' LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and objective.

However, it does not specifically identify or describe the ""selected stakeholder groups"" referenced in the question, nor does it address measurement tailored to each group individually.

To fully answer the question, you would need to:

1. Identify the specific stakeholder groups selected in Q3 (such as employees, leadership, Business Resource Groups, recruitment teams, etc.).
2. For each group:
   - Describe who they are (e.g., employees at various levels, ERG members, managers).
   - Explain how their contributions or engagement are measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals (e.g., participation rates, diverse candidate slates, promotion rates, leadership accountability metrics).
3. Confirm whether permission has been obtained to use any referenced person’s name.

---

## 1. Purpose and DE&I Context

Moody’s positions self‑identification (Self-ID) as a core enabler of its DE&I strategy, including accurate representation of LGBTQ+ employees. The organisation explicitly:

- Recognises that LGBTQ+ and other diverse groups are at risk of being undercounted.
- Links self-ID data to improving support, programmes, and inclusion outcomes, not to employment decisions.
- States that self-identification is entirely voluntary, aiming to reduce perceived coercion and protect psychological safety.

---

## 2. Data Governance and Privacy Protections

Moody’s UK Self-ID Campaign is built around strong data governance, intended to build trust and comfort in disclosing sensitive DE&I information, including LGBTQ+ status.

### 2.1 Data Accuracy

- **Employee Self-Service model**:  
  - Self-ID fields are editable only by the individual employee.  
  - Viewing rights are limited to clearly defined, authorised roles.
- This structure reduces the risk of incorrect data entry by third parties and reassures employees that they control their own information.

### 2.2 Data Retention

- **Defined retention period**: Self-ID data is retained for seven years after employment termination.
- **Destruction process**: Data is destroyed via an annual DRTM purge in December.
- **Anonymisation**: Data is anonymised during lower instance system refreshes to prevent identification in non‑production environments.
  
These measures demonstrate a clear lifecycle for sensitive DE&I data and limit long-term exposure risk.

### 2.3 Data Security and Access Controls

- **Role-Based Permissions**:
  - Only individuals with designated, appropriate access can view or edit self-ID information.
- **Export Restrictions**:
  - Self-ID data is not exportable unless specific permissions are granted, limiting misuse and uncontrolled distribution.
  
This framework signals a serious commitment to confidentiality of LGBTQ+ and other identity data.

## 3. Transparency, Communication, and Employee Education

### 3.1 Self-ID FAQ and Communication Materials

Moody’s provides a comprehensive Self-Identification FAQ document that:

- Explains:
  - That self-identification is voluntary.
  - How employees can self-identify within the WorkWise system.
- Clarifies:
  - The purpose of collecting self-ID data (to advance DE&I, including better support for LGBTQ+ employees).
  - That data will not be used in hiring, promotion, or other employment decision-making.
- Addresses:
  - Common concerns and misconceptions around privacy, usage, and access.
  - Specific worries about being “outed” or disadvantaged based on disclosed identity.

By proactively addressing concerns and explaining processes, Moody’s works to reduce fear and stigma associated with disclosing LGBTQ+ status and other DE&I attributes.

## 4. Use of Data and Non-Discrimination Commitments

Moody’s explicitly commits that:

- Self-ID information is **used solely to advance DE&I** within the organisation (e.g., representation analytics, support programmes, policy development).
- Self-ID information is **not considered in hiring or promotion decisions**, thereby:
  - Reinforcing non-discrimination.
  - Supporting trust that disclosing LGBTQ+ or other identities will not negatively affect career progression.

This separation of DE&I analytics from employment decision-making is a key responsibility for ethical handling of sensitive identity data.

---

## 5. Ongoing Support and Escalation

Employees are:

- Encouraged to refer to the Self-ID FAQ for detailed information.
- Informed of clear channels to obtain further clarification and raise concerns.

This provides a mechanism for continuous feedback and improvement of the self-ID approach, including around LGBTQ+ concerns.

1. **Proactive Monitoring of LGBTQ+-Related Issues**  
   - The procurement team uses an external news alert service to continuously monitor public information about all suppliers, including LGBTQ+-related news and incidents.  
   - This ensures early identification of any supplier behavior that may conflict with Moody’s standards on LGBTQ+ inclusion and broader ethical expectations.

2. **Alignment with Moody’s Supplier Code of Conduct**  
   - All suppliers are expected to comply with Moody’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which implicitly or explicitly covers non-discrimination and inclusive practices, including LGBTQ+ protections.  
   - If a news alert flags conduct that appears misaligned with this Code, Moody’s initiates a formal review of the supplier’s actions and policies.

3. **Clear Accountability and Escalation Mechanism**  
   - When potential non-compliance is identified:
     - A structured review with the supplier is conducted to assess facts, impact, and remediation steps.  
     - Depending on the outcome, Moody’s may require corrective action plans, enhanced oversight, or—in serious or unresolved cases—**exit the contract**.  
   - This creates a tangible accountability framework where suppliers understand that discriminatory or non-inclusive practices can have direct commercial consequences.

4. **Inclusion of LGBTQ+ Employee Voice in Supplier Assessment**  
   - For suppliers whose staff interact directly with Moody’s LGBTQ+ employees (e.g., service providers, consultants, facilities, or client-facing vendors), Moody’s actively seeks feedback from its internal Pride network.  
   - This feedback captures both:
     - **Positive experiences** (respectful treatment, inclusive language, visible allyship, safe environment), and  
     - **Negative experiences** (discrimination, microaggressions, exclusionary behavior).  
   - Employee feedback is used to evaluate supplier performance on LGBTQ+ inclusion beyond written policies, focusing on real-world behavior and culture.

5. **Positive Outcomes from This Approach**  
   - **Better supplier alignment with LGBTQ+ values**: Suppliers are incentivized to uphold inclusive practices to maintain their relationship with Moody’s.  
   - **Stronger risk management**: Continuous monitoring and feedback reduce reputational, legal, and operational risks linked to discriminatory practices in the supply chain.  
   - **Empowered LGBTQ+ employees**: The Pride network has a clear channel to influence supplier decisions, reinforcing psychological safety and trust in Moody’s processes.  
   - **Continuous improvement**: The combination of news monitoring, code-of-conduct enforcement, and employee feedback enables ongoing refinement of the supplier base toward higher LGBTQ+ DE&I standards.

1. **Integration into Performance Management**
   - Network leads are encouraged to document and discuss their LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions as part of the formal performance management process.

Based on the employee response, the organization demonstrates specific LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities in its data collection and inclusion practices:

#### 1. Inclusion of Sexual Orientation in Demographic Data
- The company explicitly collects information on **sexual orientation**, indicating recognition that LGBTQ+ identity is a relevant and protected dimension of diversity.
- This suggests:
  - Awareness that sexual orientation is an important factor in understanding workforce composition.
  - Potential use of this data to monitor inclusion, equity, and representation of LGBTQ+ employees.

#### 2. Range of Sexual Orientation Options Offered
Employees are provided with the following self-identification options:

- **Bisexual**  
- **Gay Man**  
- **Gay Woman / Lesbian**  
- **Heterosexual / Straight**  
- **Other**  
- **Undisclosed / Prefer not to share**

This structure demonstrates several DE&I-aligned practices:

1. **Recognition of Multiple LGBTQ+ Identities**
   - Inclusion of *Bisexual*, *Gay Man*, and *Gay Woman/Lesbian* acknowledges diverse non-heterosexual orientations.
   - Distinguishing “Gay Man” and “Gay Woman/Lesbian” supports specificity and visibility of different groups within the LGBTQ+ community.

2. **Inclusion of Non-Listed Identities**
   - The **“Other”** option allows employees whose orientation does not fit standard labels (e.g., pansexual, asexual, queer) to still be represented.
   - This reduces erasure of less commonly listed orientations and signals openness to broader identity spectra.

3. **Respect for Privacy and Voluntary Disclosure**
   - **“Undisclosed / Prefer not to share”** provides an explicit opt-out, supporting:
     - Employee autonomy and consent.
     - Psychological safety for employees not comfortable disclosing.
   - This aligns with good practice in data protection, confidentiality, and non-coercive DE&I measurement.

#### 3. Implications for DE&I Responsibility

By asking sexual-orientation-related questions with inclusive and privacy-respecting options, the organization:

- Takes responsibility for **measuring LGBTQ+ representation**, a prerequisite for:
  - Identifying gaps and inequities.
  - Designing targeted support, benefits, and policies (e.g., inclusive healthcare, partner benefits, ERGs).
- Demonstrates **awareness of intersectional inclusion**, moving beyond a binary view of sexual orientation.
- Shows **commitment to voluntary, respectful data collection**, aligning with:
  - GDPR-style and similar privacy principles.
  - Best practices in ESG-related human capital reporting.

---

## 1. Inclusive Recruitment Marketing

**1.1. Purposeful inclusive design**  
- Recruitment marketing materials are intentionally designed to be “as inclusive and diverse as possible,” explicitly considering LGBTQ+ inclusion.  
- Messaging and visuals are crafted to signal that diverse identities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, are welcome and valued.

**1.2. LGBTQ+-specific outreach and visibility**  
- The organisation publishes LGBTQ+-specific content, particularly around Pride, to express support and celebration of LGBTQ+ communities.  
- This content is shared via LinkedIn, reaching over 177,000 followers (including past, current, and prospective candidates), thereby amplifying visibility of the company’s LGBTQ+ inclusion stance.

**1.3. Diverse representation in employer branding**  
- Video content used in recruitment efforts intentionally includes diverse representation from hiring teams.  
- This approach is used to demonstrate, visually and authentically, that the workplace values people bringing their “authentic self” to work, including LGBTQ+ identities.

---

## 2. Inclusive Job Advertisements and Candidate Experience

**2.1. Standardised inclusivity statement in job adverts**  
All job postings include an inclusivity statement that:  
- Communicates a long-term commitment to building inclusive workplaces.  
- Emphasises that the organisation values diversity and “welcomes enquiries from everyone.”  
- Highlights openness to different ways of working, reflecting flexibility and inclusion of varied needs and identities.

**2.2. Clear DE&I access and transparency**  
- Job adverts contain links to further information on the organisation’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) commitments and inclusive culture.  
- This transparency allows LGBTQ+ candidates to assess the organisation’s culture and policies before applying, supporting informed decision-making.

**2.3. Reasonable adjustments and accessibility**  
- Candidates are explicitly invited to request “assistance or a reasonable adjustment due to a disability” as part of the application process.  
- While disability-focused, this signals a broader ethos of individual accommodation and respect for differing needs, which can also benefit LGBTQ+ candidates (e.g., trans candidates needing specific accommodations).

---

## 3. Onboarding and Integration of LGBTQ+ Talent

**3.1. Early visibility of employee networks**  
- As part of the onboarding process, all new hires receive information on internal employee networks, including the LGBTQ+ network, “Lighthouse.”  
- This ensures LGBTQ+ employees (and allies) know from the outset that there is a formal support and community structure for them.

**3.2. Reinforcement of inclusive culture from day one**  
- Introducing networks during onboarding embeds inclusion into the employee lifecycle, not just recruitment marketing.  
- It helps LGBTQ+ hires connect to community, support, and advocacy channels early in their tenure, fostering belonging and retention.

---

## 4. Cultural and Strategic Commitments Underpinning Recruitment

**4.1. Focus on “authentic self” at work**  
- The organisation explicitly states its aim to create “a place of work where the authentic self is valued and encouraged.”  
- This is critical for LGBTQ+ talent, who often assess whether they will be able to be open about their identity at work without negative consequences.

**4.2. Long-term commitment rather than one-off initiatives**  
- The inclusion language describes a “long-term commitment to building inclusive workplaces,” signalling that LGBTQ+ inclusion is part of an ongoing strategy, not a short-term campaign.  
- The recurring Pride content and standardised inclusive messaging support this sense of continuity.

---

## 5. Summary of ESG-Relevant LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities

- **Attraction & Outreach:**  
  - Leverage a large social media audience with LGBTQ+-specific and Pride-related content.

This committee is tasked with shaping our overarching I&D strategy and overseeing its implementation. Formed of representatives from across our business functions and the network chairs, the committee draws on a wide range of perspectives to manage a comprehensive I&D programme. This programme addresses inclusion related to gender, ethnicity, disability and LGBTQ+ communities, alongside mental health and wellbeing. The I&D committee holds our employee networks accountable for achieving their strategic objectives and bi-annually reports their progress to the plc Board.

Working in tandem with the networks, HR reviews these annually to ensure continuous improvement in fostering a fully inclusive environment.

The team supports the employee networks, lends expertise on maximising the effectiveness of resource groups, orchestrates events and educational activities, and facilitates cross-functional collaboration for business-wide change.

1. **All Employees**  
   - **Who they are:** All individuals working within the organization.  
   - **Measurement:** All employees are evaluated annually against five organizational objectives, one of which specifically focuses on Inclusion and Diversity (I&D).

Additionally, individual network chairs and members may have personal objectives tied to their ERG contributions, though this is optional and depends on agreements with their managers.

4. **Executive Committee**  
   - **Who they are:** Senior leadership team responsible for overall organizational strategy.

Yes, we conduct an annual review of the network strategy.

### 1. Voluntary Self‑Identification

- The organization provides an **optional** section in its HR system for employees to share **sensitive personal information**, including sexual orientation.  
- Participation is **entirely voluntary**, supporting employee privacy and autonomy.

### 2. Question Design and Presentation

- Sexual orientation is presented as a **section heading** in the HR system, labeled simply:  
  - **“Sexual Orientation”**  
- No intrusive follow-up questions are indicated; employees are presented with a single choice list.

### 3. Available Sexual Orientation Options

Employees can select from the following options:

- **Bi**
- **Gay**
- **Heterosexual**
- **Lesbian**
- **Other**
- **Decline to specify**
- **Prefer not to say**

This provides:
- Representation of several key LGBTQ+ identities (Bi, Gay, Lesbian).  
- Inclusion of **“Other”** to cover identities not explicitly listed.  
- Two forms of non-disclosure: **“Decline to specify”** and **“Prefer not to say”**, reinforcing that disclosure is optional.

### 4. Privacy and Respect for Choice

- The explicit inclusion of **opt-out options** ensures:
  - Respect for privacy and personal comfort levels.
  - Protection for employees who may not be “out” in the workplace or who have safety or cultural concerns.
- Voluntariness reduces risk of coercion or perceived pressure to disclose sensitive LGBTQ+ status.

### 5. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I

- The system allows for **data collection** that can be used to:
  - Monitor LGBTQ+ representation.
  - Identify potential gaps in inclusion or equity.
  - Tailor DE&I initiatives, benefits, and support programs to LGBTQ+ employees.
- The approach shows a **basic level of structural support** for LGBTQ+ inclusion through data capture, though:
  - It is binary-focused within “Gay/Lesbian/Heterosexual/Bi” and may not fully reflect the full spectrum (e.g., pansexual, asexual, queer as an identity label, etc.).
  - There is no explicit mention of how data is safeguarded, who has access, or how it is used, which are important aspects of DE&I responsibility regarding sensitive data.

---

**Overall**: The organization demonstrates responsibility in LGBTQ+ DE&I by enabling **voluntary, privacy-protective self-identification of sexual orientation** with multiple identity options and clear non-disclosure choices.

Here’s a polished and slightly expanded version that you could consider using:

---

We have implemented a series of ""Count Me In"" campaigns over the past few months aimed at encouraging employees to share their sensitive self-identification data. These campaigns focus on clearly communicating the business case for collecting DE&I data, helping employees understand the positive impact that sharing this information can have both on the organisation and on fostering an inclusive workplace.

To build trust and comfort around disclosure, we provide transparent information about how the data will be used, emphasizing confidentiality protocols and who has access. Importantly, we explicitly communicate areas where the data is not used—for example, it is never considered in individual performance appraisals or decisions affecting employees on a personal level.

Attached is an example of one of the promotional materials we’ve utilised—“iiBT 08 - Diversity Data Poster”—which visually supports our messaging to encourage voluntary data sharing in a respectful and informative manner.

### 1. Current Approach to LGBTQ+ Talent

- The organisation **does not currently have a specific strategy** aimed at targeting or attracting LGBTQ+ talent.
- Instead, it adopts a **broad, general DE&I positioning**, presenting itself as an **inclusive employer for all** underrepresented or diverse groups, including LGBTQ+ employees.

### 2. General DE&I Positioning

- The focus is on **promoting an inclusive culture** rather than on tailored LGBTQ+-specific attraction initiatives.
- LGBTQ+ inclusion is treated as **one component within a wider DE&I framework**, rather than as a stand‑alone workstream with dedicated actions, partnerships, or sourcing channels.

### 3. Implications for Responsibility and Practice

- **Responsibility is framed broadly**: the organisation positions itself as responsible for creating an environment where *all* employees, including LGBTQ+ individuals, feel included and valued.
- There is **no explicit accountability or dedicated measures** (e.g., targets, recruitment partnerships, LGBTQ+ outreach campaigns) specifically designed for:
  - Proactive outreach to LGBTQ+ communities and talent pools  
  - LGBTQ+-specific employer branding or visibility  
  - Monitoring or improving LGBTQ+ representation in recruitment

### 4. Areas Likely Covered Elsewhere

- The response indicates that **further details on inclusion practices** (possibly culture, policies, benefits, training, or employee networks) are addressed in the **next question**, suggesting that:
  - Structural or cultural support for LGBTQ+ inclusion may exist internally.
  - However, those measures are **not currently translated into a defined external attraction strategy** for LGBTQ+ candidates.

### 5. Overall Assessment

- The organisation **recognises DE&I broadly** and aims to be seen as an inclusive employer.
- At present, it **does not assume a distinct, proactive responsibility** for:
  - Designing dedicated LGBTQ+ recruitment pipelines  
  - Explicitly targeting LGBTQ+ jobseekers

     - **Champion LGBTQ+ events:** Organise, promote, and participate in activities such as awareness days, Pride events, panel discussions, or educational sessions.  
     - **Lead and support initiatives:** Drive campaigns or programmes focused on inclusion, such as training, communications, or policy-awareness initiatives that support LGBTQ+ equality and belonging.  

4. **Local-Level Engagement & Ownership**  
   - Emphasis on visibility and activity “in their local offices” shows that DE&I responsibility is distributed across the organisation, not only at head office or central HR.  
   - Employees are expected to contribute to an inclusive culture within their own teams and locations, reinforcing LGBTQ+ inclusion at the grassroots level.

**Overall**  
The organisation’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities are operationalised through:  
- A clear cultural message that authenticity is valued.  
- A structured LGBTQ+ Network that supports visibility, shared stories, and mutual support.  
- Active championing of LGBTQ+ events and initiatives at both central and local office levels.",70%,c4e0b57f3bd04d66a7c0d86df18286fe,"If yes, please describe how this was achieved and attach a copy of your dress code.","We have a dress and appearance policy of “Dress for your role - Dress for your day” which allows flexibility for people to wear what is most comfortable and appropriate for the needs of their day.

Would you like me to help you customize this response for your specific organization?",0%,"## Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Recognition and Reward Practices

Based on the response provided (“upporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?”), there is **no clear or substantive information** about how the organisation recognises or rewards employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion.

At present, the response:

- Does **not describe any formal programmes**, such as awards, bonuses, performance review criteria, or promotion considerations tied to LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions.
- Does **not reference informal recognition** (e.g., manager acknowledgements, shout‑outs, storytelling, internal communications).
- Does **not identify any structures or policies** (e.g., ERG leadership recognition, DE&I ambassador schemes, time allocation for DE&I work) that would show how the organisation values this work.
- Appears incomplete or possibly a typographical fragment rather than a meaningful answer.

### ESG/DE&I Interpretation

From an ESG and LGBTQ+ DE&I standpoint, this suggests:

1. **Lack of documented practice or clarity**  
   Either the organisation does not have clear mechanisms to recognise and reward LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts, or the respondent is unaware of them.

2. **Potential risk area**  
   - If employees’ DE&I contributions are not acknowledged or incentivised, this can:
     - Reduce motivation to engage in LGBTQ+ inclusion activities.
     - Place an unrecognised “second shift” burden on LGBTQ+ employees and allies.
     - Undermine the credibility of any stated DE&I commitments.

3. **Transparency gap**  
   Investors and stakeholders generally expect:
   - Clear communication of how DE&I work is valued.
   - Evidence that contributions to inclusion are integrated into performance and career outcomes.
   The lack of such information indicates a transparency and governance gap around LGBTQ+ DE&I.

---

If more detail is available (e.g., policies, examples, or internal programmes) it would be important to clarify:

- Whether LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions are included in:
  - Performance evaluations
  - Promotion criteria
  - Bonus/recognition schemes
- How Employee Resource Group (ERG) leaders and active allies are:
  - Recognised (awards, visibility)
  - Supported (time allocation, budget, development)
  - Rewarded (career progression, compensation considerations)

Without such information, the current assessment is that **no clear recognition or reward framework for LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts is demonstrated by the response.**",0%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.",actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.,"LGBT Great Feedback-- 73bit\sweta /dWed, 15 Jan 2025 07:10:31 GMT|","It looks like your response is incomplete or a placeholder.

*(Based on the employee response: “If yes, please specify how.”)*

The provided response does not contain any substantive information about LGBTQ+ Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) responsibilities, actions, or initiatives. It simply repeats the question prompt (“If yes, please specify how.”) and therefore:

- **No specific LGBTQ+ policies** are described (e.g., anti-discrimination protections, inclusive benefits, transition guidelines, etc.).
- **No DE&I programs or practices** are mentioned (e.g., employee resource groups, training, inclusive recruiting, allyship programs).
- **No accountability structures** are referenced (e.g., DE&I KPIs, leadership responsibility, reporting channels).

### Interpretation for ESG / DE&I Analysis

From this response alone, an analyst **cannot infer**:

- The existence or scope of LGBTQ+ protections.
- The company’s level of commitment or maturity on LGBTQ+ inclusion.
- Any concrete responsibilities assigned to HR, managers, leadership, or employees.

The provided response does not contain any substantive information about LGBTQ+ DE&I practices, questions, or options offered to employees. Instead, it simply repeats the original survey question:

> “1.1 If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.”

Because no actual content is provided, we can infer the following:

1. **Lack of Disclosed Detail**  
   - No specific demographic or inclusion-related questions are listed (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity, pronouns, gender expression, intersex status, etc.).
   - No answer options are described (e.g., multiple gender identities, non-binary options, “prefer not to say,” inclusive family status options, etc.).

2. **Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Assessment**  
   - It is impossible to determine:
     - Whether LGBTQ+ identities are recognized or measured in HR systems or surveys.
     - Whether inclusive answer options beyond binary gender categories exist.
     - Whether privacy-respecting options (such as “prefer not to disclose”) are provided.
     - Whether the organization systematically monitors LGBTQ+ inclusion through data.

3. **Data Gaps and ESG Considerations**  
   - From an ESG and DE&I standpoint, this constitutes a **data gap**:
     - No evidence of structured LGBTQ+-inclusive demographic data collection.
     - No evidence of thoughtful design of response options to reflect diverse identities.
   - Without this information, the organization’s accountability and transparency on LGBTQ+ DE&I cannot be evaluated for this question.

4. **What Would Be Expected for Robust LGBTQ+ DE&I**  
   (Not present in the response, but typically expected)
   - Clear questions such as:
     - Sexual orientation (with multiple inclusive options + “prefer not to say”).
     - Gender identity (including non-binary and trans-inclusive options).
     - Pronouns (optional).
   - Confidentiality assurances and voluntary participation.
   - Clear explanation of why data is collected and how it supports inclusion.

**Conclusion:**  
The response fails to specify any actual questions or options related to LGBTQ+ DE&I. As a result, no concrete assessment of the organization’s responsibilities, practices, or inclusiveness toward LGBTQ+ employees can be made from this data point alone.",0%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",,,fd6dda376f6f459792eb3900f7bf9076,How does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,ow does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:-- 73bit\sweta /dWed, 15 Jan 2025 09:29:44 GMT|",1c803de936754166af98c835fb6cd5b1,"What campaigns, strategies or approaches has your organisation undertaken to improve comfort around disclosing self-ID DE&I data?","ampaigns, strategies or approaches has your organisation undertaken to improve comfort around disclosing self-ID DE&I data?","LGBT Great Feedback-- 73bit\sweta /dWed, 15 Jan 2025 09:29:44 GMT|","It looks like your response is incomplete or may have been copied incorrectly.

Based on the response, there is **no clear evidence** that the organisation has defined or implemented specific campaigns, strategies, or approaches to improve comfort around disclosing self‑identification (self‑ID) DE&I data, including LGBTQ+ data.

The response submitted:

> “ampaigns, strategies or approaches has your organisation undertaken to improve comfort around disclosing self-ID DE&I data?”

appears to simply repeat or partially copy the question, and does **not** describe:

- Any **communication campaigns** (e.g., awareness drives, town halls, FAQs) explaining why self‑ID data is collected and how it will be used.
- Any **privacy and confidentiality measures** communicated to employees to build trust around data handling.
- Any **training or guidance** for managers or HR on how to talk about self‑ID and DE&I data sensitively.
- Any **LGBTQ+‑specific initiatives**, such as:
  - Collaboration with LGBTQ+ ERGs/affinity groups on messaging and trust‑building.
  - Use of inclusive language and options in self‑ID forms (e.g., multiple gender identities, sexual orientations, and pronoun options).
  - Clear opt‑in/opt‑out mechanisms and assurance that non‑disclosure will not affect employment.

### ESG / DE&I Assessment

From an ESG and LGBTQ+ DE&I perspective, the response suggests:

- **Lack of documented strategy**: There is no articulated approach to encourage voluntary, safe self‑ID.
- **Potential gaps in governance**: No mention of data protection, anonymisation, or compliance frameworks.
- **Limited transparency**: Employees may not have clear information on why and how self‑ID data is collected and protected.
- **Unclear inclusion focus**: No direct reference to LGBTQ+ comfort, psychological safety, or representation in the process.

### Recommended Elements to Address

To strengthen LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities in this area, the organisation would typically be expected to:

1. **Develop clear communication** explaining:
   - Purpose and benefits of self‑ID (e.g., better policies, benefits, and support for LGBTQ+ staff).
   - Voluntary nature of disclosure.
   - How data is stored, anonymised, and used.

2. **Engage LGBTQ+ employees/ERGs** to:
   - Co‑design survey language and categories.
   - Identify barriers to disclosure and address them.

3. **Ensure robust data privacy**:
   - Clear data governance, limited access, and anonymised reporting.
   - Compliance with local data protection laws.

4. **Provide training**:
   - For HR, managers, and leaders on inclusive discussions about identity and data.
   - On how self‑ID supports broader DE&I commitments.

Based solely on the response given, the organization:

- **Does not provide any evidence** of structured efforts to target or attract LGBTQ+ talent.  
- **Does not articulate** policies, practices, or programs related to LGBTQ+ DE&I in recruitment.  

To demonstrate meaningful LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility in talent attraction, the organization would need to describe tangible measures such as:

- Targeted outreach and partnerships with LGBTQ+ organizations and job boards.  
- Inclusive branding, recruitment materials, and interview practices.

- **Employee Support Programs:** Many have established employee resource groups and mentoring programs specifically for LGBT+ staff, fostering a supportive workplace culture.
- **Community Engagement:** Our suppliers participate in and sponsor events that support LGBT+ rights and awareness, demonstrating their commitment beyond their internal policies.

**b. Community Engagement**
- Support LGBTQ+ community organizations, events, and advocacy consistent with local law and company values.
- Offer volunteering opportunities or partnerships that advance LGBTQ+ rights, inclusion, and economic empowerment.

---

## 4. Positive Outcomes Typically Expected from LGBT+ Suppliers

In the absence of specific examples in the response, typical positive DE&I outcomes from an LGBT+ supplier could include:

1. **Improved Inclusion Metrics**
   - Higher employee engagement and lower turnover among LGBTQ+ employees.
   - Positive feedback in climate or culture surveys regarding belonging and respect.

2. **Enhanced ESG Performance**
   - Stronger social (S) metrics, including diversity indicators and fair labor practices.

   - Visibility and normalization of LGBTQ+ leadership in the supply chain.
   - Participation in advocacy or policy dialogues that improve protections for LGBTQ+ communities.

---

## 5. Evidence and Accountability Mechanisms

To demonstrate accountability, an LGBT+ supplier is generally expected to provide:

- **Policy Documentation:** Copies of DE&I, non-discrimination, and anti-harassment policies that name LGBTQ+ protections.
- **Training Records:** Evidence of completed LGBTQ+ awareness/bias training.
- **Metrics & Reporting:** Aggregated data on workforce diversity, retention, inclusion survey scores, and/or supplier diversity spend, where lawful and appropriate.
- **Certifications & Memberships:** Recognition as an LGBT+-owned business or memberships in LGBTQ+ business organizations.
- **Case Studies:** Short narratives of how their practices led to tangible outcomes (e.g., improved employee wellbeing, successful diverse hiring initiatives, or impactful community projects).

  - LGBTQ+-specific DE&I awards,
  - broader DE&I or inclusion awards, or
  - recognition from external organizations, industry bodies, or community groups.

### ESG / LGBTQ+ DE&I Implications

From this response alone, we **cannot** conclude:

- That the organization has received any LGBTQ+ or DE&I-related awards; or  
- That it has not received such awards.

The answer is effectively **non-responsive** or incomplete rather than a clear “none.”

For an ESG or LGBTQ+ DE&I assessment, this means:

- **Evidence of external recognition for LGBTQ+ inclusion is absent.**  
- Any claims about awards or best-practice standing would require **additional verification** (e.g., HR/DE&I lead confirmation, corporate website, sustainability report, or third‑party award lists).

### Recommended Follow-up

To clarify the organization’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and recognition, it would be necessary to ask for:

1. A **direct statement** whether any DE&I or LGBTQ+-specific awards have been received.
2. If yes:
   - **Award name**
   - **Issuing body**
   - **Year(s) received**
   - **Scope** (company-wide, regional, site-specific, LGBTQ+‑focused or general DE&I)
3. Any **public documentation** (press releases, ESG reports, or external rankings) that corroborates these awards.

Without that additional information, the organization’s external validation in LGBTQ+ DE&I cannot be evaluated from this response.",80%,3ac73018ecc64c8fb4a16011b6e4994b,"For each of the selected responses in Q2, please provide examples of the actions taken.","For each of the selected responses in Q2, please provide examples of the actions taken.","2.2 For each of the selected responses in Q2, please provide examples of the actions taken.

As our work in DEI matures, we know that the objectives and how they are measured, will have to evolve to match our progress","As outlined, no LGBTQ+ specificity in goals and objectives as yet.

Managers are responsible for conducting informal performance reviews throughout the year, while all staff members, including Executive Committee members, participate in formal annual appraisals. These appraisals review past performance and set future goals, focusing on not only what objectives were achieved but also how they were accomplished, particularly in alignment with the Artemis cultural principles.

Currently, there are no specific LGBTQ+ DE&I objectives set for the Executive Committee or other stakeholder groups. This means that individual performance goals do not include explicit measures related to LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, it is acknowledged that as the organization's DEI efforts mature, the objectives and measurement criteria will need to evolve to incorporate such goals more explicitly.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Groups Covered

**a. Managers across the business**  
- Includes line managers and middle management responsible for overseeing teams and delivering business objectives.  

**b. All staff**  
- All employees at all levels of the organisation.  

**c. Executive Committee**  
- Senior leadership responsible for strategic direction, culture, and governance.  
- Includes Senior Managers and Certified staff whose fitness and propriety are assessed.

---

## 2. Current Performance Management Framework

### 2.1 Informal Reviews (Managers and Staff)
- Managers are encouraged to hold **regular informal reviews** during the year.  
- Purpose: Ongoing feedback on performance, behaviour, and development.  
- LGBTQ+ DE&I:  
  - No explicit LGBTQ+-specific goals.  
  - Any DE&I-related expectations are embedded implicitly through cultural and behavioural standards rather than through specific LGBTQ+ metrics.

### 2.2 Annual Appraisals (All Staff, Including Executive Committee)
- All staff, including Executive Committee members, undergo a **formal annual appraisal**.  
- Objectives:  
  1. Review performance over the previous year.  
  2. Set goals and targets for the year ahead.  
  3. Evaluate both:
     - **“What”**: Business and role-based results delivered.  
     - **“How”**: Behaviours and alignment with **Artemis cultural principles**.

- Measurement dimensions:
  - Achievement of role-specific and business objectives.  
  - Demonstration of cultural principles (e.g., collaboration, respect, integrity), which are indirectly relevant to inclusive behaviour, including LGBTQ+ inclusion, but not explicitly defined as such.

---

## 3. Link to LGBTQ+ DE&I Goals

### 3.1 Behaviour and Culture-Based Expectations
- The appraisal process evaluates **how** objectives are achieved, requiring commentary on:
  - Whether and how individuals demonstrate the firm’s cultural principles in their day-to-day behaviour.
- While there is no **explicit LGBTQ+-specific metric**, expectations of:
  - Respectful conduct,  
  - Inclusive behaviour, and  
  - Alignment with culture  
  inherently cover inclusive treatment of LGBTQ+ colleagues and stakeholders, albeit in a general, non-targeted way.

### 3.2 Absence of Specific LGBTQ+ Objectives
- **Executive Committee**:
  - Do not have **specific objectives** tied to individual DE&I strands (e.g., LGBTQ+, race, gender).  
  - Consequently, **no defined LGBTQ+-specific performance targets or KPIs** at Executive level.
- **Other stakeholder groups (all staff, managers)**:
  - Similarly, no formal **LGBTQ+-specific objectives** embedded in appraisals or performance expectations.
- Measurement of LGBTQ+ DE&I progress is therefore:
  - **Qualitative and indirect**, via cultural-behavioural criteria, rather than through explicit, strand-specific goals or quantitative indicators.

---

## 4. Governance and Regulatory Alignment (Senior Managers and Certified Staff)

- The annual appraisal also serves to assess **individual fitness and propriety** for:
  - Senior Managers and  
  - Certified staff (in line with regulatory expectations).
- While not explicitly LGBTQ+-focused, this implies:
  - An expectation of ethical conduct, non-discrimination, and compliance with firm policies (which typically include equal opportunities and anti-harassment, relevant to LGBTQ+ inclusion).
- Measurement:
  - Pass/fail or risk-based view of whether behaviour (including any discriminatory behaviour) is compatible with holding a regulated role.

---

## 5. Maturity and Future Direction of DE&I Objectives

- The organisation recognises that:
  - **Current DE&I objectives are not strand-specific** (no separate LGBTQ+ objectives).
  - As DE&I work **matures**, the firm expects that:
    - Objectives will evolve, and  
    - Measurement frameworks will be **refined and strengthened**.
- Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I:
  - Future development may include:
    - Defined LGBTQ+ representation or inclusion targets,  
    - Specific inclusive leadership goals for managers and the Executive Committee,  
    - Clearer performance indicators tied to LGBTQ+ inclusion (e.g., survey scores, participation in LGBTQ+ initiatives, policy implementation).

---

## 6. Permission to Use Names

- The response provided **does not reference any individual by name**.  
- Therefore, no specific permission is required or applicable, and there is no named individual whose consent needs to be confirmed.",95%,0e5cee8da6d243ed8d4c091a6d8bbff5,How does your organisation recognise and reward employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"All partners and employees are incentivised and rewarded in relation to their contribution to the business. Our Executive Committee members are rewarded based on their contribution to the business, which is assessed on an ongoing basis, and in the annual appraisal, as described in question 4. Performance is measured against objectives and assessed on the bases of what has been delivered as well as how it has been delivered. There are no LGBT+ specific recognition or rewards.","Again, no LGBTQ+ specificity as yet.-- LGBTGreat/Clara /dWed, 02 Oct 2024 12:12:43 GMT|","The organisation recognises and rewards employees based on their overall contribution to the business, with performance measured against objectives and how those objectives are achieved. This applies to all partners and employees, including Executive Committee members, whose performance is reviewed both continuously and during an annual appraisal. However, there are currently no specific recognition or reward programs targeted at contributions related to supporting LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I).",100%,"## Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Recognition and Reward Practices

### 1. Overall Reward Framework

- All partners and employees are rewarded **based on their contribution to the business**.  
- Executive Committee members are similarly rewarded based on their **ongoing contribution**, formally reviewed in the **annual appraisal** process.  
- **Performance assessment** considers:
  - *What* has been delivered (results, business outcomes), and  
  - *How* it has been delivered (behaviours, conduct, alignment with values).

### 2. Integration of DE&I into Performance

- The response indicates that **“how” work is delivered** is part of performance assessments, which can implicitly cover inclusive behaviours, including support for LGBTQ+ colleagues.
- However, there is **no explicit link** made between LGBTQ+ DE&I support and specific performance metrics or objectives.

### 3. LGBTQ+‑Specific Recognition and Rewards

- The organisation states clearly that there are **no LGBT+ specific recognition or reward mechanisms**.
- This means:
  - No dedicated awards, bonuses, or incentives specifically tied to LGBTQ+ DE&I activities.
  - No specific formal recognition frameworks (e.g., LGBTQ+ allyship awards, ERG leadership recognition) mentioned for LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions.

### 4. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility

- **Recognition of effort** in LGBTQ+ DE&I is likely:
  - **Indirect and general**, folded into overall behavioural and performance evaluations when relevant.
  - Dependent on managers’ interpretation of the “how” criteria rather than guided by a clear, DE&I‑specific framework.
- **Responsibility for LGBTQ+ DE&I** appears:
  - Not formally embedded as a distinct, measurable performance criterion.
  - Not tied to **specific, trackable rewards** that would highlight and reinforce LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts.

### 5. Areas for Potential Strengthening

Based on the response, potential enhancements could include:

- Introducing **explicit LGBTQ+ DE&I performance indicators** (e.g., inclusive leadership, allyship, support for LGBTQ+ ERGs) within appraisal criteria, especially for leaders.
- Creating **formal recognition mechanisms** (awards, spotlight programs, or incentive components) specifically for impactful LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions.
- Clarifying how **support for LGBTQ+ inclusion** is expected, assessed, and rewarded across levels, particularly for executives and people managers.

In sum, the organisation’s reward system is performance-based and considers both outcomes and behaviours, but it currently **does not provide LGBTQ+‑specific recognition or incentives**, and DE&I contributions (including LGBTQ+ support) are only implicitly recognised within the broader “how” of performance delivery.",95%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","Michael Browning, the lead of our Sexual Orientation work strand of the DEI working group, approached the group with a plan for Pride month activities.

Our interview process is more standardised, with increased HR involvement and challenge. • Taking a more coordinated approach to learning and development and leveraging specific programmes to support diverse talent. Examples include mentoring for female talent through the 30% club, targeted training for managers on policy and process, including recruitment (run by the HR team) and soft skills in conjunction with a specialist provided. • Supporting the pipeline of talent through active engagement with partners who specialise in working with young people in education (second and third level) to raise the profile of the investment management industry as an attractive career choice.

Based on the employee’s response, the organization gathers voluntary LGBTQ+ demographic data through its HR Information System (HRIS). This carries several Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) responsibilities:

---

### 1. LGBTQ+‑Inclusive Demographic Questions

**a. Gender Identity**

Employees are invited (but not required) to self-identify their gender using the following options:

- Man  
- Non‑binary  
- Woman  
- Prefer to self‑describe (with a free‑text box)  
- Prefer not to say  

**DE&I implications:**

- Recognizes identities beyond the traditional male/female binary by including **Non‑binary**.
- Respects individual complexity by allowing **“Prefer to self‑describe”**, enabling identities not covered by predefined options (e.g., genderqueer, agender, two‑spirit, etc.).
- Protects privacy and consent with **“Prefer not to say”**, acknowledging that disclosure is voluntary and that employees may not feel safe or comfortable sharing.

---

**b. Sexual Orientation**

Employees can disclose their sexual orientation with the following options:

- Asexual  
- Bisexual  
- Gay man  
- Gay woman / lesbian  
- Pansexual  
- Straight or heterosexual  
- Prefer to self‑describe (with a free‑text box)  
- Prefer not to say  

**DE&I implications:**

- Includes multiple non‑heterosexual orientations (asexual, bisexual, gay, lesbian, pansexual), providing **visibility and recognition** for a broad spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities.
- Uses both **“gay man”** and **“gay woman/lesbian”** to reflect the way different groups may prefer to self‑identify.
- Provides **“Prefer to self‑describe”** to allow identities not listed (e.g., queer, demisexual, questioning).
- Preserves autonomy and psychological safety through **“Prefer not to say”**.

---

### 2. Key DE&I Responsibilities Linked to This Practice

By collecting this information, the organization assumes several responsibilities:

1. **Voluntariness and Non‑Discrimination**
   - Ensure that answering these questions is clearly optional.
   - Guarantee that non‑disclosure (“Prefer not to say”) does **not** negatively affect employment, evaluation, benefits, or progression.

2. **Data Privacy and Confidentiality**
   - Treat gender identity and sexual orientation as **sensitive personal data**.
   - Store responses securely, with strict access controls and limited use.
   - Communicate clearly how the data will be used (e.g., aggregate DE&I reporting, program design) and how it will **not** be used (e.g., individual performance or disciplinary decisions).

3. **Respectful, Inclusive Language**
   - Regularly review category labels in consultation with LGBTQ+ employees or ERGs to keep terminology up to date and culturally sensitive.
   - Ensure that the “self‑describe” fields are respected and, where appropriate, reflected in internal systems without forcing people into predefined labels.

4. **Use of Data for Equity and Inclusion**
   - Analyze data in aggregate to identify disparities in **recruitment, promotion, pay, retention, and engagement** for LGBTQ+ employees.
   - Use findings to design targeted policies, training, and benefits (e.g., inclusive health coverage, transition‑related care, family leave, anti‑harassment measures).

5. **Transparency and Communication**
   - Explain to employees **why** this data is collected (e.g., to measure progress on LGBTQ+ inclusion) and how it supports broader DE&I commitments.
   - Share high‑level, anonymized results and actions taken, demonstrating that disclosure leads to concrete improvements.

6. **Safeguarding and Cultural Support**
   - Ensure an environment where LGBTQ+ employees feel safe to disclose if they wish—supported by:
     - Clear anti‑discrimination and anti‑harassment policies covering sexual orientation and gender identity.
     - Inclusive leadership behaviors and training.
     - Mechanisms to report incidents confidentially and without retaliation.

---

### 3. Summary

The HRIS questions on gender identity and sexual orientation are **broadly inclusive** and **voluntary**, with options to self‑describe and to decline to answer. This framework:

- Recognizes diverse LGBTQ+ identities.
- Respects employee autonomy and privacy.
- Enables the organization to measure and advance LGBTQ+ inclusion.

To meet ESG and DE&I expectations, the organization must pair this data collection with strong privacy protections, non‑discrimination guarantees, transparent communication, and concrete actions to improve outcomes for LGBTQ+ employees.",60%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",,,fd6dda376f6f459792eb3900f7bf9076,How does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"From our current point, working to encourage more staff to anonymously report on their sexual orientation through our staff survey is the first step to improving LGBT+ DEI at Artemis.

- Creating a safe and confidential environment for data disclosure  
- Offering anonymous ways to disclose data  
- Sharing success stories or testimonials that highlight the positive impact of data collection  
- Providing training sessions to address concerns and build trust  
- Ensuring clear communication about how the data will be used and protected  

Here is a refined version of your response incorporating some of these elements:

---

Before we began collecting self-ID DE&I data, we proactively communicated with staff through emails and calls to explain the purpose of data collection and how it would support our inclusion goals. We emphasized confidentiality and the voluntary nature of disclosure to create a safe environment for participation. Additionally, each time one of our workstreams hosts an event or we share DE&I communications, we remind and encourage staff to disclose this data, reinforcing the importance and benefits of their participation. To further build comfort, we have incorporated anonymous disclosure options and regularly share how the aggregated data informs positive changes within the organization, helping staff see the tangible impact of their input.

---

If your organization has other specific campaigns or resources, feel free to include those details as well.",80%,"Below is a structured ESG-style summary of the organisation’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and actions related to improving comfort around disclosing self‑ID data, based on the employee response.

---

## 1. Strategic Objective

**Goal:**  
Increase employee comfort and willingness to disclose self-identification (self‑ID) DE&I data (including LGBTQ+ and other diversity characteristics) in order to:

- Better understand workforce composition.
- Inform and improve DE&I initiatives.
- Track progress and impact over time.

---

## 2. Communication and Awareness Campaigns

### 2.1 Pre‑Collection Explanation

**Actions:**

- **Email Communications:**  
  Prior to initiating data collection, the organisation sent emails to staff explaining:
  - Why self‑ID DE&I data was being collected.
  - How the information would be used to support DE&I efforts.
  - The benefits of this data for improving inclusion and representation.

- **Staff Calls / Meetings:**  
  The organisation used staff calls (all‑hands or similar forums) to:
  - Provide verbal explanations and clarifications.
  - Address potential concerns in real time.
  - Reinforce that the purpose is inclusion, not monitoring or penalising.

**ESG/DE&I Significance:**
- Demonstrates a proactive transparency approach.
- Helps build trust by explaining intent and expected impact before asking employees to disclose.

---

## 3. Ongoing Reinforcement and Encouragement

### 3.1 Integration with DE&I Workstreams and Events

**Actions:**

- **Event-Based Reminders:**  
  Whenever one of the DE&I workstreams delivers an event (e.g., awareness sessions, talks, celebrations):
  - The organisation uses these as touchpoints to remind and encourage staff to complete or update their self‑ID data.

- **DE&I Communications as a Channel:**  
  In addition to events, any DE&I-related communications (e.g., newsletters, internal announcements, thematic campaigns) are used to:
  - Reiterate why self‑ID data matters.
  - Encourage voluntary participation in data disclosure.

**ESG/DE&I Significance:**
- Treats self‑ID data collection as an ongoing cultural practice, not a one‑off survey.
- Connects data disclosure to visible DE&I activities, reinforcing that the data directly supports real initiatives.

---

## 4. Responsibility and Accountability

### 4.1 Organisational Responsibilities Demonstrated

The organisation is:

- **Responsible for Clear Purpose-Setting:**  
  It has explicitly stated the purpose and intended benefits of collecting self‑ID data.

- **Responsible for Informed Consent:**  
  By explaining the rationale and intended use before collection, it supports more informed, voluntary disclosure.

- **Responsible for Continuous Engagement:**  
  It uses repeated touchpoints (events, communications) to sustain awareness and normalise self‑ID disclosure as part of its DE&I culture.

### 4.2 Opportunities to Strengthen Responsibility (Implied Gaps)

While not mentioned in the response, mature LGBTQ+ DE&I practice typically also includes:

- Clear statements on privacy, data protection and who can access self‑ID data.
- Assurance that non‑disclosure will not result in negative consequences.
- Evidence of how self‑ID data has tangibly shaped policies, benefits, or inclusion efforts.

These are areas the organisation could further articulate to enhance trust and comfort around disclosure.

---

## 5. Overall Summary

The organisation’s main strategies to improve comfort around disclosing LGBTQ+ and broader DE&I self‑ID data are:

1. **Upfront transparency and education** via emails and staff calls before data collection starts.
2. **Ongoing reinforcement** by tying reminders and encouragement to existing DE&I workstreams, events, and communications.

Our interview process is more standardised, with increased HR involvement and challenge. • Supporting the pipeline of talent through active engagement with partners who specialise in working with young people in education (second and third level) to raise the profile of the investment management industry as an attractive career choice. We have built relationships with partners who work to raise the profile of the industry among underrepresented groups including girls and young people from socio economic groups that may not have been aware of the investment industry. These include Future Asset, Arrival Education, and Investment 20/20. We are also signing up to internship programmes through Girls Are Investors (GAIN) and 10,000 Black Interns. While these do not specifically target LGBT+ talent, we hope that by broadening the net we will see an increase of talent across all of the DEI strands.

- Engaging with educational partners to raise awareness of the investment management industry among underrepresented groups such as girls and socio-economically disadvantaged youth.

- Participating in internship programmes like Girls Are Investors (GAIN) and 10,000 Black Interns, which, while not specifically LGBTQ+ focused, help broaden diversity.

- Organising Pride month activities, including changing the company logo to reflect Pride, posting a video message from the CIO on LinkedIn, and raising internal and external awareness of LGBTQ+ issues.

  - Leading or organizing LGBTQ+ network events or campaigns.
  - Participating in LGBTQ+ awareness, training, or mentoring.
  - Supporting initiatives that improve LGBTQ+ inclusion, representation, or employee experience.
  - Acting as visible allies (e.g., speaking at events, sponsoring programs, influencing policies).

Based on the employee’s response, the organization appears to collect information on sexual orientation as part of its Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) efforts. The structure and options used reflect both inclusivity and respect for privacy.

### 1. Nature of the Question Asked

The employer asks a demographic question related to **sexual orientation**. While the exact wording is not provided, it is likely along the lines of:

- “What is your sexual orientation?”

This question is typically asked in:

- DE&I or demographic surveys  
- Onboarding or HR self-identification forms  
- Periodic employee engagement or census surveys  

The purpose is usually to understand representation of LGBTQ+ employees and to inform DE&I policies, support programs, and monitoring of equity outcomes.

### 2. Response Options Provided

Employees can select from the following options:

1. **Bisexual**  
2. **Gay or lesbian**  
3. **Heterosexual or straight**  
4. **Other**  
5. **Prefer not to say**

**Key DE&I implications of these options:**

- **Explicit LGBTQ+ categories (Bisexual, Gay or lesbian):**  
  Recognizes and validates specific LGBTQ+ identities rather than treating them as an “other” or omitting them entirely. This supports visibility and more accurate representation.

- **Heterosexual or straight:**  
  Ensures that data capture allows comparison between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ employees for equity analysis (e.g., promotion, pay, engagement).

- **Other:**  
  Acknowledges that sexual orientation is diverse and that some employees may identify outside the listed categories (e.g., pansexual, asexual, queer, etc.). This helps avoid forcing employees into inaccurate labels.

- **Prefer not to say:**  
  Respects **privacy and consent**, a key DE&I and ethical principle. Employees are not compelled to disclose sensitive personal information and can still participate in surveys without outing themselves.

### 3. DE&I Responsibilities Reflected

From this structure, the organization’s responsibilities and practices likely include:

- **Inclusion:**  
  - Recognizing multiple sexual orientations, including LGBTQ+ identities.  
  - Providing an “Other” option to include further identities not explicitly named.

- **Non-discrimination and safety:**  
  - By asking the question in a structured way, the organization assumes a responsibility to ensure that data is used only in aggregate and not for adverse employment actions.  
  - Protecting employees from discrimination based on disclosed orientation.

- **Privacy and autonomy:**  
  - Offering “Prefer not to say” reflects a commitment to voluntary disclosure.  
  - Implies a duty to maintain confidentiality and to communicate clearly how data will be stored, used, and protected.

- **Monitoring and accountability:**  
  - Collecting this data enables the organization to monitor representation, identify potential disparities affecting LGBTQ+ employees, and track progress on DE&I goals.  
  - Supports targeted initiatives (e.g., inclusive benefits, ERGs, training).

### 4. Areas to Potentially Enhance Inclusivity (Implied Considerations)

While not required by the question, best practice considerations based on the options given:

- Ensuring that **“Other”** can be optionally specified (free-text) if systems and privacy standards allow, to better understand and support less commonly listed identities.
- Clearly communicating to employees:
  - Why this data is collected  
  - That responses are confidential and (ideally) aggregated and de-identified  
  - That participation is optional and has no impact on employment decisions  

---

**Summary:**  
The organization asks employees to self-identify their sexual orientation using a set of options—Bisexual; Gay or lesbian; Heterosexual or straight; Other; Prefer not to say—that indicate a structured and relatively inclusive approach to LGBTQ+ DE&I data collection, coupled with respect for employee privacy and autonomy.",70%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",Gender identity: Female Male Other Prefer not to say Transgender,,fd6dda376f6f459792eb3900f7bf9076,How does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"We use the data to monitor demographic shifts at Jupiter.

Since beginning to collect sexual orientation and gender identity data in 2023, we have observed a 3-4% increase in disclosure rates. Initially, we launched a targeted communications campaign to encourage self-identification at the point of data collection. Although we have not implemented specific initiatives to further drive disclosure this year, we are encouraged by the incremental rise in participation. We attribute this positive trend, at least in part, to our ongoing, broad, and visible inclusion efforts that foster a culture of trust and safety around DE&I topics.

If you would like, I can also help you develop additional strategies or messaging ideas to further increase disclosure comfort in the future.",100%,"**Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities Related to Self‑ID Disclosure**

1. **Introduction of LGBTQ+ Self‑ID Data Collection (2023)**  
   - The organisation began collecting self‑identification data on:
     - **Sexual orientation**  
     - **Gender identity**  
   - This represented the **first formal effort** to gather LGBTQ+ demographic data, a foundational step in understanding and addressing the needs and representation of LGBTQ+ employees.

2. **Initial Communications Campaign to Support Disclosure**  
   - At the time of launch in 2023, the organisation ran a **targeted communications campaign** aimed at:
     - Explaining **why** self‑ID data is being collected (e.g., to support inclusion, measure representation, inform policies).  
     - Encouraging employees to **voluntarily disclose** their sexual orientation and gender identity.  
     - Likely addressing **confidentiality and data protection** concerns (implicit in responsible DE&I data collection).  
   - This campaign was the primary strategy used to **build comfort and trust** around sharing sensitive DE&I information.

3. **Measured Improvement in LGBTQ+ Self‑ID Disclosure Rates**  
   - Since starting data collection, the organisation has observed a **3–4% increase in disclosure** for:
     - Sexual orientation  
     - Gender identity  
   - This indicates growing employee comfort with self‑identification and suggests that initial communications and broader inclusion efforts are having a positive effect.

4. **No Targeted Self‑ID Campaigns in the Current Year**  
   - In the most recent period, the organisation has **not undertaken specific or new campaigns** focused solely on:
     - Increasing LGBTQ+ self‑ID disclosure  
     - Re‑promoting the self‑ID process  
   - Despite the lack of targeted activity, disclosure has continued to **rise incrementally**, suggesting trust and comfort are improving organically.

5. **Role of Broader Inclusion Efforts**  
   - The organisation attributes the ongoing increase in self‑ID rates to its **“broad and visible efforts on inclusion.”**  
   - While not detailed in the response, this implies:
     - A generally **inclusive culture and visible leadership commitment** to DE&I.  
     - Broader DE&I initiatives that may include training, employee resource groups, inclusive policies, and visible LGBTQ+ allyship.  
   - These wider efforts appear to **indirectly encourage** employees to feel safer and more comfortable disclosing LGBTQ+‑related personal data.

6. **Implied Responsibilities and Practices**  
   Based on the description, the organisation is demonstrating several key LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities related to self‑ID data:

   - **Establishing mechanisms for voluntary LGBTQ+ self‑identification**  
     - Creating space for employees to disclose sexual orientation and gender identity if they choose.
   
   - **Promoting informed, trust‑based participation**  
     - Using communications campaigns to explain the purpose and value of self‑ID and to support transparency and understanding.
   
   - **Monitoring and evaluating progress**  
     - Tracking changes in self‑ID disclosure rates (e.g., noting the 3–4% increase) as a DE&I performance indicator.
   
   - **Embedding inclusion beyond data collection**  
     - Relying on a broad, visible inclusion agenda rather than one‑off campaigns, so that employees’ comfort with self‑ID grows as part of a **wider cultural shift**.
   
   - **Respecting voluntary participation and employee autonomy**  
     - No evidence of coercive or overly insistent tactics; disclosure is treated as a voluntary act within a supportive environment.

**Overall Assessment**

The organisation has taken foundational steps in LGBTQ+ DE&I by introducing sexual orientation and gender identity self‑ID in 2023, supporting it with an initial communications campaign, and then relying on broader, visible inclusion efforts to sustain and increase comfort.

  - **Relevant to DE&I goals** (e.g., measuring representation, inclusion, and equity).
  - **Respectful and inclusive**, avoiding stigmatizing or invasive language.
  - **Consistent** across geographies where legally and culturally appropriate.

Because the response refers to information “above,” this suggests that the specifics (e.g., how sexual orientation or gender identity questions are framed) have been documented previously and form part of the company’s standing DE&I practice.

---

### 2. Responsibility to Provide Inclusive and Voluntary Answer Options

Even though not repeated here, the referenced section would typically need to:
- Offer **inclusive options**, such as:
  - Multiple sexual orientation options (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, queer, straight/heterosexual, “prefer to self-describe”).
  - Multiple gender identity options (e.g., woman, man, non-binary, genderqueer, transgender, “prefer to self-describe”).
- Include **“prefer not to say”** and/or “choose not to disclose” options, to:
  - Protect employee privacy.
  - Reinforce that disclosure is **voluntary**, not mandatory.
- Where relevant, allow **free-text/self-description** to avoid forcing individuals into inaccurate categories.

These answer structures are a central part of an employer’s DE&I responsibility, as they reduce misclassification and respect the self-identification of LGBTQ+ employees.

---

### 3. Responsibility for Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Use

By choosing to ask LGBTQ+‑related questions at all, the organization carries the responsibility to:
- Collect such data **confidentially**, ideally in aggregated, non-identifiable form for analytics.
- Communicate **clearly how the data will be used**, for:
  - Monitoring representation and inclusion.
  - Identifying inequities in recruitment, promotion, pay, or retention.
  - Designing targeted support or benefits (e.g., inclusive health coverage, ERGs).
- Respect **local legal and regulatory requirements**, especially in jurisdictions where LGBTQ+ disclosure could pose risks to employees.

---

### 4. Responsibility for Transparency in ESG / DE&I Reporting

From an ESG perspective, referencing prior information (“See above”) implies:
- The company considers LGBTQ+ data collection part of a broader, documented DE&I framework.
- For external stakeholders (investors, regulators, rating agencies), the company should:
  - Make the **question design and options transparent** at a policy or framework level.
  - Explain **why** these questions are asked and how they align with DE&I commitments.
  - Demonstrate that the process is **voluntary, respectful, and safe** for employees.

---

### 5. Governance and Continuous Improvement

The organization’s obligations also include:
- **Periodic review** of LGBTQ+ categories and language with:
  - Internal LGBTQ+ employee resource groups.
  - DE&I councils, and, where needed, external experts.
- **Updating** wording and answer options to:
  - Reflect evolving terminology and best practice.
  - Address employee feedback on comfort, clarity, and inclusiveness.

---

**Overall ESG Implication**

While the direct response offers no new detail (“See above”), it implies that the organization:

- Already has a structured set of LGBTQ+ demographic questions and answer options.
- Accepts responsibility to manage this sensitive data respectfully, inclusively, and in compliance with privacy and human rights standards.
- Integrates LGBTQ+ data collection into its broader DE&I governance, measurement, and reporting framework.",20%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",,,fd6dda376f6f459792eb3900f7bf9076,How does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,We use this data to inform practice.

To further enhance these efforts, you might consider the following approaches:

1. **Anonymous Surveys and Feedback Mechanisms:** Allow employees to share their self-ID information and feedback anonymously to build trust and comfort over time.

2. **Clear Communication on Data Privacy:** Regularly communicate how the DE&I data will be used, emphasizing confidentiality and the positive impact it will have on creating an inclusive environment.

3. **Leadership Involvement:** Encourage leaders to openly discuss the importance of self-ID data and share their own journeys, which can normalize disclosure.

4. **Safe Spaces and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs):** Facilitate forums where employees can discuss DE&I topics safely, which can foster trust.

5. **Incentivize Participation:** Highlight how disclosing self-ID data contributes to tailored programs, benefits, and support.

If you would like, I can help you develop materials or plans for these strategies!",40%,"### Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities and Actions

Based on the employee response, the organisation has begun implementing foundational initiatives to improve comfort around disclosing self-ID DE&I data, particularly for LGBTQ+ employees.

#### 1. Pronouns Campaign
- **Objective:** Normalize sharing and respecting pronouns to create a more inclusive environment for gender-diverse employees.
- **Typical Activities Likely Involved:**
  - Encouraging employees to add pronouns to email signatures, collaboration tools, and name badges.
  - Providing short guidance or FAQs on why pronouns matter and how to use them respectfully.
  - Internal communications (e.g., intranet posts, newsletters, posters) explaining the link between pronoun use, gender identity inclusion, and psychological safety.
- **Relevance to Self-ID Disclosure:**
  - Signals that diverse gender identities are acknowledged and respected.
  - Helps reduce stigma around gender identity and expression, making it safer for employees to disclose this information in self-ID fields.
  - Contributes to a culture where discussion of identity is normalized rather than treated as exceptional.

#### 2. Allyship Trainings
- **Objective:** Build a base of informed, active allies who can support LGBTQ+ colleagues and foster a more inclusive climate.
- **Core Components Typically Covered:**
  - Education on LGBTQ+ terminology, experiences, and common challenges at work.
  - Guidance on how to respond to bias, microaggressions, and exclusionary behaviour.
  - Practical behaviours of allyship (e.g., speaking up, using inclusive language, respecting confidentiality).
- **Relevance to Self-ID Disclosure:**
  - Increases employees’ confidence that colleagues and leaders will respond respectfully to disclosed identities.
  - Reduces fear of harassment or discrimination, which is a key barrier to accurate self-ID.
  - Reinforces the message that the organisation values diversity and expects inclusive behaviour from all staff.

---

### Overall ESG/DE&I Implication

While the response is brief, it indicates that the organisation is:

- Taking **culture-shaping steps** (pronouns campaign) to normalize identity expression.
- Investing in **behavioural change and awareness** (allyship trainings) to build a safer environment.

These are early but important components of an LGBTQ+-inclusive DE&I strategy that can improve employee comfort with self-identification, provided they are:
- Voluntary and respectful of privacy,
- Reinforced by policy and leadership behaviour,
- Accompanied by clear communication on why self-ID data is collected and how it is protected.",100%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,We will start to recruit more strategically at local colleges/universities.

This would demonstrate a comprehensive and committed approach to LGBTQ+ recruitment and inclusion.",100%,"**LGBTQ+ DE&I Talent Attraction – Structured Summary**

Below is a structured ESG-focused summary of the organisation’s stated responsibilities and practices for targeting and attracting LGBTQ+ talent, based on the employee response.

---

## 1. Strategic Recruitment & Sourcing

**a. Targeted outreach to educational institutions**  
- The organisation plans to recruit “more strategically” at **local colleges and universities**.  
- There is an explicit intention to **target LGBTQI+ students and early-career talent** at these institutions, suggesting a move toward building an LGBTQ+ pipeline at the entry level.

**ESG/DE&I implication:**  
This indicates an emerging approach to proactive outreach rather than passive reliance on general applicant pools, which can help increase representation of LGBTQ+ individuals in junior and graduate roles.

---

## 2. Use of LGBTQ+ Friendly Job Platforms

**a. Posting on LGBTQ+ inclusive job boards**  
- Positions are posted on **LGBTQ+ / LGBTQI+ friendly job boards**.  
- This is presented as an ongoing practice used to reach LGBTQ+ candidates more effectively.

**ESG/DE&I implication:**  
Using specialised job boards is a tangible step to ensure that job opportunities are visible to LGBTQ+ job seekers, and it signals an openness and commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion in recruitment channels.

---

## 3. Inclusive Job Descriptions

**a. Inclusive language in postings**  
- **Job descriptions include inclusive language**, designed to welcome LGBTQ+ applicants and reduce exclusionary or biased phrasing.

**ESG/DE&I implication:**  
Inclusive language is a foundational DE&I practice that helps minimize barriers to entry and fosters a perception of psychological safety from the first point of contact. This also supports equal-opportunity and non-discrimination commitments.

---

## 4. Representation in Employer Branding

**a. Inclusive recruiting videos**  
- **Recruiting videos will be updated** during the year.  
- The update will include a **focus on LGBTQI+ employee success at Natixis**, highlighting existing LGBTQ+ talent, their stories, and achievements.

**ESG/DE&I implication:**  
Showcasing LGBTQ+ employee success in employer branding helps demonstrate that LGBTQ+ staff can thrive and advance within the organisation. It supports authenticity, visibility, and a sense of belonging for prospective applicants, moving beyond policy language to lived experience.

---

## 5. Stage of Implementation and Forward-Looking Commitments

**a. Current vs. planned actions**  
- Some measures appear to be **already in place** (use of LGBTQ+ job boards, inclusive language in job descriptions).  
- Other measures are **planned or in progress** (strategic college/university outreach, updated recruiting videos with LGBTQ+ focus).

**ESG/DE&I implication:**  
The organisation is in a **developmental/strengthening phase** of its LGBTQ+ recruitment strategy. It has established basic inclusive practices and is now working toward more proactive, visible, and targeted actions.

---

## 6. Overall DE&I Responsibility Profile (LGBTQ+ Focus)

Based on the response, the organisation’s LGBTQ+ talent attraction responsibilities can be summarised as:

1. **Access & Visibility**  
   - Ensuring LGBTQ+ candidates see roles advertised in spaces that explicitly welcome them (LGBTQ+ friendly job boards, targeted campus outreach).

2. **Inclusive Communication**  
   - Using **inclusive, non-discriminatory language** in job descriptions to reduce bias and signal a safe, equitable workplace.

3. **Representation & Storytelling**  
   - Updating recruitment materials (especially videos) to **showcase LGBTQ+ employees’ success**, reinforcing that LGBTQ+ staff can grow and be recognized.

4. **Pipeline Development**  
   - Building a **long-term talent pipeline** by targeting LGBTQ+ students and graduates at local colleges and universities.

While the response does not reference formal policies (e.g., non-discrimination clauses, benefits, ERGs) or metrics (e.g., tracking LGBTQ+ representation in hiring), it demonstrates a concrete and evolving operational focus on **inclusive recruitment channels, messaging, and representation** for LGBTQ+ talent.",100%,46ef82a559454c6ca1181e78b607dfa0,How does your organisation seek to position itself as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer?,"We will be making an effort to build relationships at local colleges to work with their LGBTQ students and build brand awareness.

Our DEI strategy is ultimately the responsibility of our Board with LCP’s CEO as executive responsible for DEI outcomes. The strategy is overseen by a DEI Committee which includes LCP’s Head of People, Head of HR, our DEI manager, another senior partner, and a senior representative from each of our four DEI networks. There is no single area of responsibility as it is central to our entire culture and people principles. The LCP Board, with the support of the DEI Committee, regularly reviews our overall DEI strategy, long-term objectives, DEI purpose and vision and supports the Networks, including the LGBTQ+ Network, to articulate their long-term aims and objectives. To support this strategy, the DEI Committee sets overarching areas of focus and success criteria each year with input from the Networks and stakeholders across LCP and each of the four DEI Networks (LGBTQ+, Women’s, Wellbeing, Multicultural) also agree individual success criteria each year. Progress is regularly reviewed by the DEI Committee to reflect on progress over the year and agree next steps. The current overarching aims and long-term objectives for the LGBTQ+ network are below: • Provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for LCPers who identify as LGBTQ+ o Run a series of socials and events o Drive attendance at regular coffee mornings o Work with HR to understand whether LGBTQ+ colleagues are overrepresented in leavers from LCP • Have an influence outside our network by raising awareness, being visible, and supporting our wider community o Increase visibility by posting on Viva Engage o Use events and other means to raise money for our nominated charities, where relevant and appropriate to do so • Promote LCP externally as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer, expanding and deepening LCP’s connections with clients, peers and industry groups. o Build on success of last year’s client event o Continue to support industry groups such as O:Pen, LINK, and TIDE o Build connections with LGBTQ+ individuals as clients and firms who refer us work. Examples of the success criteria against these objectives specific to this year include: • Running at least three socials / events, with at least one to have a trans awareness focus • Work with other networks to deliver intersectional events (eg book or film clubs, or a panel event) • Target average attendance at coffee mornings of 10+ people • A fundraising target of £1,500 for the year plus matching from the LCP Foundation • Target 120+ attendees with similarly positive feedback for an annual client event • Utilise LGBT Great training credit",,"The responsibilities for LGBTQ+ DE&I within the organisation are shared across multiple levels and groups, reflecting an integrated approach to inclusion. Specifically:

- **All Employees:** Everyone in the organisation is responsible for fostering inclusion as part of the overall culture and people principles.

- **Board and CEO:** The Board holds ultimate responsibility for the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategy, with the CEO serving as the executive accountable for DEI outcomes.

- **DEI Committee:** This committee oversees the DEI strategy and includes the Head of People, Head of HR, the DEI manager, a senior partner, and senior representatives from each of the four DEI networks, including the LGBTQ+ Network. They regularly review the DEI strategy, long-term objectives, and DEI purpose, and support the networks to develop their goals.

- **LGBTQ+ Network and Other DEI Networks:** The LGBTQ+ network, alongside other networks, sets specific annual success criteria aligned with the overall DEI aims. Their responsibilities include:
  - Creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ employees by organizing socials, coffee mornings, and collaborating with HR to monitor LGBTQ+ colleague retention.
  - Raising awareness and visibility both within and outside the organisation, such as through social media engagement (e.g., posting on Viva Engage), fundraising, and events.
  - Promoting LCP externally as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer by enhancing connections with clients, peers, and industry groups (e.g., O:Pen,",100%,,0%,35cc2d603789460ca6a7860e603cf021,"For each of the selected stakeholder groups in Q3, please describe who they are and how they are measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and objectives.

If you need help refining this answer or ensuring it addresses all parts of the question fully, here are a few suggestions:

1. **Identify Stakeholder Groups Clearly:**  
   Since the question references “each of the selected stakeholder groups in Q3,” make sure you specify who those groups are (e.g., employees, management, external partners, LGBTQ+ ERGs).

2. **Describe Each Group:**  
   Briefly describe the role or relevance of each stakeholder group to LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts.

3. **Measurement Methods:**  
   Expand on both qualitative and quantitative methods, specifying how these are applied to each stakeholder group. For example:  
   - Employees: Annual appraisals with DE&I objectives, participation in events, feedback surveys.  
   - Managers: Incorporation of DE&I goals in leadership KPIs, team culture assessments.  
   - ERG Leaders: Number of events hosted, engagement metrics, outreach success.  
   - External Partners: Compliance with inclusive policies, support for LGBTQ+ initiatives.

4. **Permission to Use Names:**  
   Address the permission aspect separately and clearly state your process for obtaining consent to use individuals' names in reports or communications.

Here’s a refined example response based on your draft:

- **Employees:** Employees are measured against personalized objectives",100%,"Below is a structured ESG-style summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and measurement, based on the employee’s response.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Groups and Who They Are

The response refers generally to “all stakeholders” rather than naming specific stakeholder groups. In this context, the relevant groups can be interpreted as:

1. **Individual Employees (including managers and leaders)**  
   - All staff who have personal objectives related to LGBTQ+ diversity, equity & inclusion.  
   - This can include:
     - LGBTQ+ employees  
     - Allies  
     - People managers  
     - Senior leaders with DE&I responsibilities  
     - Network/ERG leads and sponsors  

2. **Internal Stakeholders Providing Feedback**  
   - Colleagues who interact with the individual (e.g., team members, cross-functional partners, direct reports, managers).  
   - DE&I teams or HR where relevant.  
   - Members of the LGBTQ+ network and allies who can comment on engagement and impact.

3. **External Stakeholders (Implicit)**  
   - External contacts engaged through LGBTQ+ events or networking (e.g., partner organizations, event participants), insofar as their participation and feedback may be used to assess objectives like organizing and attending events.

No specific person is named in the response, so permission to use individual names is not applicable here.

---

## 2. How Stakeholders Are Measured Against LGBTQ+ DE&I Goals

### 2.1 Individual Employees

**Measurement Mechanism:**  
- **Annual Appraisal / Performance Review**  
  - Each individual is assessed against their own **personal objectives** that may include LGBTQ+ DE&I goals.

**Types of Objectives and Metrics:**

1. **Quantitative Objectives**
   - Clear, countable targets related to LGBTQ+ DE&I activities, for example:
     - “Organise two external networking events for the LGBTQ network and allies.”  
       - Measurement: Confirm that two external events were successfully organized within the year (date, scope, participants, outcomes).
     - “Attend at least [X] LGBTQ+ events during the year.”  
       - Measurement: Track attendance count against the numeric target [X] (e.g., via calendars, sign-in sheets, registrations).

   - These are measured on a **completion basis**:  
     - Target met / exceeded / not met, often with supporting documentation or records.

2. **Qualitative Objectives**
   - Broader, behavior- or impact-focused goals (e.g., being an inclusive leader, supporting LGBTQ+ colleagues, actively contributing to the LGBTQ+ network).
   - These are measured via:
     - **Qualitative feedback** from stakeholders (peers, reports, managers, network members).  
     - Narrative assessment in the annual appraisal (e.g., examples of inclusive behavior, advocacy, visible support).

**Overall Responsibility:**
- Each employee is responsible for:
  - Achieving their defined LGBTQ+ DE&I objectives.  
  - Demonstrating inclusive behavior, allyship, and engagement where relevant to their role.  
- Performance outcomes can influence:
  - Overall performance rating, development plans, and potentially progression, where DE&I is integrated into core performance expectations.

---

## 3. Role of Stakeholder Feedback in Measurement

**Qualitative Feedback Collection:**
- Feedback is “gathered and collated from all stakeholders.” This typically includes:
  - Direct manager’s evaluation.
  - Peer and team feedback (including LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies).
  - Input from those involved in or impacted by LGBTQ+ events and activities.

**Usage of Feedback:**
- To provide:
  - A more holistic view of how the individual supports LGBTQ+ DE&I in practice.
  - Evidence of inclusive behaviors, respectful collaboration, and effective advocacy.
- To supplement:
  - Quantitative completion of activities with insights into **quality**, **impact**, and **authentic engagement**.

---

## 4. Confirmation of Permission to Use Names

- The response **does not reference any named person**.  
- Therefore, no explicit permission statement is required or provided.  
- If names were to be used in future reporting or case examples, explicit consent from those individuals would be needed and should be documented.

---

### Summary

- **Who is measured?** Individual employees (including managers, leaders, and network leads) are measured against personal LGBTQ+ DE&I objectives.  
- **How are they measured?**  
  - **Quantitatively** via clear, numerical targets (e.g., number of events organized or attended).  
  - **Qualitatively** via stakeholder feedback and narrative assessment during annual appraisals.  
- **Names and permissions:** No individuals are named in the response, so permission to use specific names is not applicable in this instance.",60%,0e5cee8da6d243ed8d4c091a6d8bbff5,How does your organisation recognise and reward employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"Performance against objectives is measured at annual appraisals, and feeds into bonus and pay review consideration. There is a large degree of discretion to annual bonuses, and therefore significant efforts to supporting DEI causes can be rewarded. Time spent on LGBTQ+ inclusion activities, or on wider DEI leadership, is considering “productive time” when it comes to reviewing hours charged as part of year end appraisals. In addition our employee recognition awards include an award category focussed on those making an impact in the DEI and within the broader CSR space. Individuals are nominated by other colleagues for the work and effort they put in with those with significant achievements being fully recognised across the business for their contribution.",,"Your response clearly outlines how your organisation recognises and rewards employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I. Here's a polished version that enhances clarity and flow:

---

Performance against objectives is evaluated during annual appraisals and factors into bonus and pay review considerations. There is considerable discretion in awarding annual bonuses, allowing significant efforts in supporting DE&I initiatives to be acknowledged and rewarded. Time devoted to LGBTQ+ inclusion activities or broader DEI leadership is counted as “productive time” when reviewing hours charged during year-end appraisals.

Additionally, our employee recognition awards include a dedicated category for individuals making a meaningful impact in DEI and the wider CSR space. Employees are nominated by their colleagues for their contributions, and those with notable achievements receive company-wide recognition for their efforts.

Your organisation incorporates support for LGBTQ+ diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) into both formal performance systems and informal recognition mechanisms. The main elements are:

---

### 1. Integration into Performance Management and Pay

- **Annual Appraisals:**  
  - Contribution to LGBTQ+ inclusion and broader DE&I is assessed as part of the annual performance review process.  
  - Performance against DE&I-related objectives can positively influence overall performance ratings.

- **Impact on Bonus and Pay Review:**  
  - Appraisal outcomes feed into **bonus** allocation and **pay review** decisions.  
  - Because there is a **large degree of discretion** in annual bonuses, managers can specifically recognise **significant DE&I efforts**, including LGBTQ+ inclusion work, through higher bonus awards where justified.

---

### 2. Recognition of LGBTQ+ DE&I Work as “Productive Time”

- **Productive Time Classification:**  
  - Time spent on **LGBTQ+ inclusion activities** or **wider DEI leadership** is explicitly treated as **“productive time”**.  
  - This ensures that participation in DE&I initiatives does not count negatively against employees in **year‑end hours and utilisation reviews**.
  - Practically, this means employees can engage in LGBTQ+ DE&I work without being penalised for reduced client‑billable or core role hours.

---

### 3. Formal Recognition Awards

- **Dedicated DE&I / CSR Award Category:**  
  - The organisation’s recognition programme includes a specific award category for those making a strong impact in **DE&I** and the broader **CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)** space.
  - This provides a **visible, formal pathway** to recognise LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts.

- **Peer Nominations:**  
  - Employees are **nominated by colleagues**, highlighting peer‑driven recognition of LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions.
  - This encourages a culture in which DE&I work is noticed and valued across teams, not only by line managers.

- **Organisation‑wide Visibility:**  
  - Individuals with **significant achievements** in DE&I are **fully recognised across the business**, ensuring:
    - Public acknowledgement of their contributions.
    - Role modelling of inclusive behaviours for others.
    - Strong cultural signalling that LGBTQ+ DE&I work is important and prestigious.

---

### 4. Overall Responsibility Framework

Taken together, these practices mean that employees who support LGBTQ+ DE&I can expect:

- Their efforts to be **formally evaluated** in appraisals.  
- A **direct link** between DE&I contributions and **bonus/pay outcomes**, via discretionary bonus decisions.  
- Assurance that DE&I work is **counted as legitimate, productive work**, not a side activity.  
- Opportunities for **high‑profile recognition** through awards and organisation‑wide communication.

This framework embeds LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibility into both the **performance** and **recognition** systems, reinforcing that inclusive behaviour and leadership are core, rewarded aspects of an employee’s role.",100%,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","Mentoring and Reverse mentoring Mandatory firm-wide training on DEI for new joiners Training for our Partner Champions and Active Allies Participation in LGBT Great’s mentoring programme Participation and leadership of O:Pen, the LGBTQ+ Network for the pensions industry.

Could you please provide the specific question or the content you are referring to? That way, I can help you draft a clearer and more complete answer.",0%,"Below is a structured interpretation of the response within an LGBTQ+ DE&I (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) responsibilities context, given the limited information provided.

---

## 1. Context of the Response

- The answer provided is: **“As above.”**
- This implies that the respondent has already described relevant actions, policies, or responsibilities in a previous answer and is referring back to that prior explanation rather than restating it.

Because the referenced content (“above”) is not included here, we cannot extract or confirm the specific LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities. However, we can still clarify what this type of answer typically signifies from an ESG/DE&I analysis perspective.

---

## 2. Interpretation from an ESG/DE&I Perspective

When someone answers “As above” to a question like *“If yes, please specify how”* (in an LGBTQ+ DE&I context), it usually means:

1. **Responsibilities are not distinct from general DE&I policies**  
   - The organization or individual is likely applying the same policies, practices, and mechanisms to LGBTQ+ inclusion that were described previously for broader DE&I (e.g., anti-discrimination policies, inclusive benefits, training, recruitment practices).
   - In ESG terms, LGBTQ+ DE&I is integrated into overall diversity and inclusion strategy rather than treated as a separate, standalone component.

2. **No additional, LGBTQ+-specific details provided at this step**  
   - There are **no newly stated responsibilities** or measures unique to LGBTQ+ employees in this particular response.
   - Any LGBTQ+ focus must therefore be inferred from the earlier mentioned measures (for instance, if earlier they referenced inclusive language, equal benefits, harassment reporting channels, etc.).

3. **Potential implications for ESG evaluation**  
   - From a disclosure quality standpoint, the response is **referential rather than explicit**.
   - This can:
     - Make it harder to assess the **specificity and robustness** of LGBTQ+ policies and practices.
     - Suggest that while LGBTQ+ inclusion may be covered, it has **not been clearly articulated or disaggregated** from general DE&I responsibilities in this specific answer.

---

## 3. What Would Typically Be Expected (But Is Not Explicitly Stated Here)

In a more complete LGBTQ+ DE&I description, one would expect explicit reference to responsibilities such as:

- Clear **non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies** that explicitly name sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
- **Inclusive benefits and policies**, e.g.:
  - Health coverage and leave policies inclusive of same-sex partners and transgender-related care.
  - Gender-neutral parental leave.
- **Workplace practices**:
  - Training on LGBTQ+ inclusion and unconscious bias.
  - Use of correct names and pronouns.
  - Inclusive facilities (e.g., gender-neutral restrooms).
- **Representation and voice**:
  - LGBTQ+ employee resource groups.
  - Mechanisms to raise concerns safely and confidentially.
- **Monitoring and accountability**:
  - Tracking inclusion metrics (where legal and appropriate).
  - Leadership accountability for inclusive culture and non-retaliation.

None of these are confirmed by the response “As above”; they are simply examples of what might have been covered in the referenced earlier answer.

---

## 4. Summary

- The response **“As above”** indicates that the explanation of “how” LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities are handled has already been given in a prior answer and is being cross-referenced.
- In ESG analysis terms, this:
  - Shows **integration** of LGBTQ+ DE&I into broader DE&I responsibilities.
  - But provides **no additional, explicit detail** at this point, limiting the ability to assess LGBTQ+-specific measures from this response alone.
- For a fuller ESG assessment, access to the referenced “above” content is necessary to identify concrete LGBTQ+ DE&I policies, practices, and accountability mechanisms.",0%,3e632f5b929d46c2aadf3c89df0a0b98,"For each of the selected options in Q3, please describe how your LGBTQ+ DE&I strategy addresses each option.","All supplier onboarding includes a questionnaire on their inclusion policies.

Based on the employee’s response, the company’s LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) responsibilities can be summarized as follows:

---

### 1. Inclusive Data Collection on Sexual Orientation

The organization actively collects self-reported data on sexual orientation, indicating a responsibility to:

- **Recognize sexual orientation as a core aspect of diversity**  
  The question explicitly asks about sexual orientation, signaling that LGBTQ+ identities are considered an important part of workforce demographics and inclusion efforts.

---

### 2. Range of Sexual Orientation Options Offered

The options provided show an attempt to cover a broad spectrum of orientations beyond a traditional binary or heteronormative framework:

- **Asexual** – Recognizes individuals who experience little or no sexual attraction.
- **Bisexual** – Recognizes attraction to more than one gender.
- **Gay male** – Explicit acknowledgment of gay men as a distinct group.
- **Gay/lesbian female** – Explicit acknowledgment of gay and lesbian women.
- **Heterosexual** – Recognizes straight employees within the same framework.
- **Omnisexual** – Recognizes attraction to all genders, often with gender as a salient factor.
- **Pansexual** – Recognizes attraction regardless of gender.

By offering this range, the employer assumes responsibility to:

- **Validate multiple LGBTQ+ identities**, including less commonly listed ones (e.g., asexual, omnisexual, pansexual).
- **Avoid erasure of non-heterosexual identities** by explicitly including them in demographic questions.

---

### 3. Respect for Privacy and Autonomy

Two options highlight the company’s responsibility to protect employee choice and privacy:

- **“Prefer not to disclose”** – Acknowledges employees’ right not to share sensitive personal information and helps prevent coercion.
- **“Prefer to self-describe”** – Allows employees to define their own identity in their own terms if provided categories do not fit, supporting autonomy and self-identification.

These options embody responsibilities to:

- **Avoid forcing disclosure of LGBTQ+ status** or any sexual orientation.
- **Respect the complexity and fluidity of identities** by not restricting employees to fixed labels.

---

### 4. Implicit DE&I Commitments

By asking these questions in this way, the organization implicitly commits to:

- **Use the data to inform DE&I strategy**, such as:
  - Monitoring inclusion and representation of LGBTQ+ employees.
  - Identifying potential inequities (e.g., in promotion, pay, engagement).
- **Handle data confidentially and ethically**, given the sensitivity of sexual orientation information.
- **Promote a culture where LGBTQ+ identities are acknowledged and normalized**, not ignored or invisibilized.

---

### 5. Relevance to ESG and LGBTQ+ Inclusion

From an ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and DE&I perspective, this practice suggests:

- **Social / S (Human Capital & Diversity):**  
  - The employer is moving beyond minimal compliance by recognizing multiple sexual orientations.
  - They are creating the basis for tracking inclusion and outcomes for LGBTQ+ populations.

- **Governance / G (Policies & Safeguards):**  
  - The structure of response options (“prefer not to disclose,” “self-describe”) implies some level of policy awareness regarding privacy and non-discrimination.

  Increase employee comfort with disclosing self‑ID DE&I data by showing that inclusion is a leadership priority and that sharing identity data is normalised and valued.

### 2. Emphasis on Data Security, Privacy, and Appropriate Use
- **Clear messaging on data handling:**  
  Communications explicitly focused on:
  - Reassuring colleagues that their diversity data is stored securely.
  - Explaining that the data will be used only in appropriate, clearly defined ways (e.g., to improve DE&I policies and programmes, not for punitive or discriminatory purposes).

- **Responsibility:**  
  The organisation acknowledges its responsibility to:
  - Protect sensitive identity data (including LGBTQ+ status).
  - Build trust by explaining data governance, confidentiality, and limited access.
  - Use aggregated insights, not individual disclosures, to support DE&I outcomes.

### 3. Integration into the Employee Lifecycle (Onboarding)
- **Standard onboarding process:**  
  Data collection is signposted as part of the normal onboarding journey for new joiners, which:
  - Normalises self‑ID and frames it as a standard, voluntary element of joining the organisation.
  - Ensures every new employee is informed early about how and why diversity data is collected.
  - Supports LGBTQ+ and other under‑represented employees by signalling that identity is recognised and respected from day one.

- **Responsibility:**  
  Embed DE&I data practices structurally into HR processes rather than treating them as ad‑hoc initiatives.

### 4. Ongoing Communication and Reinforcement
- **Regular campaign reminders:**  
  The organisation keeps the self‑ID campaign visible and active by:
  - Including reminders and signposting in most firm‑wide updates.
  - Referencing the campaign and its importance in training sessions.

- **Goal:**  
  Maintain continuous, low‑pressure encouragement rather than one‑off asks, helping:
  - Employees who may need more time to feel comfortable disclosing.
  - LGBTQ+ employees who may be assessing organisational trust and safety over time.

### 5. Building an Inclusive and Informed DE&I Strategy
- **Purpose of data collection:**  
  While not exhaustively described, the approach implies that:
  - Self‑ID DE&I data (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and other dimensions) is used to understand representation, experiences, and potential inequities.
  - Better data enables more targeted and effective DE&I initiatives, policies, and support for LGBTQ+ and other communities.

- **Responsibility:**  
  Use collected data to:
  - Identify gaps and barriers.
  - Inform resource allocation, training focus, and policy development.
  - Track progress over time and report on outcomes in an aggregated, non‑identifying way.

Based on the response, the organization’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and expectations for suppliers can be summarized as follows:

---

#### 1. Formal DE&I Requirement for Suppliers  
- The company has a **Statement of Supplier Expectations** that explicitly includes **diversity and inclusion requirements**, which would encompass LGBTQ+ inclusion.  
- Compliance with this Statement is a **core condition** of doing business with the company.

---

#### 2. Ongoing Monitoring and Accountability  
- The company **actively monitors** supplier performance “throughout their provision of services,” not just at onboarding.  
- This monitoring includes checking that suppliers **continue to meet DE&I expectations**, including LGBTQ+ inclusion, as part of a broader ESG/compliance framework.

---

#### 3. Clear Consequences for Non-Compliance  
- If a supplier **fails to comply** with any part of the Statement of Supplier Expectations—including the diversity and inclusion elements—this triggers a clear consequence:  
  - The company will **cease working with that supplier**.  
- This establishes a **strong accountability mechanism**: suppliers understand that maintaining inclusive practices (including LGBTQ+ inclusion) is **contractually and commercially significant**.

---

#### 4. Implicit Positive Outcome  
- While no specific LGBTQ+-focused examples (e.g., inclusive benefits, ERGs, or policies) are provided, the **positive outcome** is implicit in the structure:
  - Only suppliers that **meet and maintain** the company’s diversity and inclusion requirements, including LGBTQ+ aspects, can **remain in the supply chain**.  
- This creates a **continuous incentive** for suppliers to uphold and potentially improve their LGBTQ+ DE&I practices.

---

### Overall ESG / DE&I Assessment

- The company embeds LGBTQ+ DE&I expectations in a **formal supplier code** and uses **ongoing monitoring plus a clear exit mechanism** as enforcement.  
- However, the response:
  - Does **not provide concrete examples** of specific LGBTQ+-related initiatives or outcomes at supplier level (e.g., anti-discrimination policies, training, representation data, inclusive benefits, or community engagement).  
  - Focuses more on **compliance and enforcement** than on **proactive or measurable positive LGBTQ+ outcomes**.

---

## Context

**Question asked:**  
“For each of the selected answers in Q1, please describe what responsibilities they have for LGBTQ+ DE&I in your organisation.”

**Employee’s response:**  
“For each of the selected answers in Q1, please describe what responsibilities they have for LGBTQ+ DE&I in your organisation.”

This means the respondent has simply repeated the question and has not provided any substantive description of responsibilities. As a result, there is no organisation-specific information about LGBTQ+ DE&I roles to summarise.

---

## Implications of the Response

1. **No Defined Responsibilities Provided**  
   - The response does not list any roles (e.g. HR, senior leadership, line managers, ERGs, or DE&I teams).  
   - It also does not describe any concrete responsibilities (e.g. policy development, training, reporting, or support mechanisms).

2. **Inability to Derive Role-Specific Duties**  
   - Because Q1’s selected answer(s) are not shown and the respondent did not elaborate, we cannot attribute responsibilities to:
     - Executive leadership / Board
     - HR / People team
     - DE&I / ESG function
     - People managers
     - Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
     - All employees  
   - Any attempt to assign specific responsibilities would be speculative and not grounded in the respondent’s input.

---

## Typical LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities (Generic Framework)

Since the response is empty of detail, below is a **generic** framework of responsibilities that organisations commonly assign. This is **illustrative only** and **not derived from the employee’s answer**:

1. **Board / Executive Leadership**
   - Set clear expectations that LGBTQ+ inclusion is a strategic priority.
   - Approve and oversee LGBTQ+-inclusive policies and benefits.
   - Hold senior leaders accountable for progress against LGBTQ+ DE&I metrics.

2. **HR / People & Culture**
   - Develop and implement LGBTQ+-inclusive policies (non-discrimination, harassment, transition-at-work policies, inclusive leave).
   - Ensure recruitment, promotion, and performance processes are free from anti-LGBTQ+ bias.
   - Provide LGBTQ+ awareness, allyship, and anti-bullying/harassment training.

3. **DE&I / ESG Function**
   - Develop the LGBTQ+ inclusion strategy and roadmap.
   - Track and report LGBTQ+ DE&I data (where lawful and voluntary).
   - Coordinate initiatives such as Pride events, awareness days, and learning campaigns.

4. **Line Managers / People Managers**
   - Foster inclusive team cultures and intervene in discriminatory behaviour.
   - Support LGBTQ+ team members, including respecting privacy and identities.
   - Ensure team practices (rotas, social events, communications) are LGBTQ+-inclusive.

5. **LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG) / Network**
   - Provide peer support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ employees.
   - Advise the organisation on policy, communication, and culture from a lived-experience perspective.
   - Partner with HR/DE&I on training, events, and external advocacy.

6. **All Employees**
   - Follow policies and uphold an LGBTQ+-inclusive code of conduct.
   - Challenge discriminatory language and behaviour.
   - Act as allies (e.g. using correct names/pronouns, inclusive language, and respecting confidentiality).

---

## Summary

- The employee’s response does **not** describe any actual LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities within their organisation; it simply repeats the question.
- Therefore, no organisation-specific responsibilities can be summarised from the data provided.
- The generic framework above outlines what such responsibilities typically look like across key stakeholder groups, but it should not be treated as a description of the respondent’s organisation without further clarification.",90%,35cc2d603789460ca6a7860e603cf021,"For each of the selected stakeholder groups in Q3, please describe who they are and how they are measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and objectives.

However, the provided response does **not** actually answer the question; it simply repeats the question text and does not identify any stakeholder groups, metrics, or permissions. As a result, there is no substantive information about LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities to analyze.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Groups

**Observation:**  
The response does not list or describe any stakeholder groups (e.g., employees, leadership, HR, suppliers, customers, community partners, etc.).

**Implication:**  
- We cannot determine:
  - Who the selected stakeholder groups in Q3 are.
  - What roles they play in LGBTQ+ DE&I.
  - How they are expected to support or be accountable for LGBTQ+ inclusion.

To give a meaningful ESG assessment, the following would be needed:
- A list of stakeholder groups selected in Q3 (for example: “All employees,” “People managers,” “Executive leadership,” “HR / DE&I team,” “External partners,” etc.).
- A brief description of each group’s role in the organization.

---

## 2. Measurement Against LGBTQ+ DE&I Goals and Objectives

**Observation:**  
The response provides no details on:
- Metrics,
- KPIs,
- Qualitative assessments, or
- Performance processes

related to LGBTQ+ DE&I.

**Implication:**  
We cannot identify:
- How each stakeholder group is measured or held accountable for:
  - LGBTQ+ representation and hiring,
  - Retention and promotion of LGBTQ+ employees,
  - Inclusive culture and psychological safety,
  - Training/education on LGBTQ+ inclusion,
  - Policy adherence (e.g., anti-discrimination, benefits, transitioning policies),
  - Engagement with LGBTQ+ communities or ERGs.

To fully describe responsibilities and measurement, we would expect information such as:
- For managers: performance goals tied to inclusive leadership behaviors and diverse hiring/promotion outcomes.
- For executives: DE&I targets incorporated into annual objectives, bonus criteria, or board oversight.
- For HR/DE&I teams: responsibility for collecting and reporting LGBTQ+ inclusion metrics and running programs.
- For employees: participation in mandatory training, adherence to codes of conduct, and contribution to an inclusive culture.

---

## 3. Permission to Use Individuals’ Names

**Observation:**  
The question explicitly asks:  
“Please confirm that you have the permission of the person referenced to use their name.”

The response:
- Does not mention any names.
- Does not confirm or deny that permission has been obtained.
- Does not address privacy or consent.

**Implication:**  
From the response, we cannot confirm:
- Whether any individuals are referenced.
- Whether consent was obtained for use of their names in LGBTQ+ DE&I reporting or disclosures.

A compliant response would:
- Either avoid using specific names, or
- Explicitly state:  
  - Which individuals are named, and  
  - That permission has been obtained from each, or  
  - That only anonymized/aggregated data is used.

---

## 4. Overall ESG / LGBTQ+ DE&I Assessment Summary

Based solely on the provided text:

- **Clarity of stakeholder responsibilities:** Not provided.
- **Definition of LGBTQ+ DE&I objectives per stakeholder group:** Not provided.
- **Measurement and accountability mechanisms:** Not provided.
- **Consent for name usage:** Not confirmed.

Thus, no concrete LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities or measurement practices can be derived from the response.

---

## 5. Guidance for Improving the Response

To produce a complete, ESG-aligned answer, the organization should revise the response to include:

1. **Who the stakeholders are** (for each group selected in Q3), such as:
   - All employees
   - People managers and leaders
   - Executive team and Board
   - HR/DE&I function
   - Employee resource groups (e.g., LGBTQ+ ERG)
   - Suppliers/partners (if applicable)

2. **How each group is measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals**, for example:
   - Quantitative KPIs (e.g., LGBTQ+ representation, retention, promotion rates, survey scores on inclusion).
   - Qualitative expectations (e.g., inclusive behaviors, participation in LGBTQ+ initiatives, support for ERGs).
   - Integration into formal performance reviews or incentive schemes.

3. **Confirmation of permission** for any individual named:
   - “We confirm that we have the explicit permission of [Name] to use their name in this context,”  
     or  
   - “No individual names are used; all data is aggregated and anonymized.”

Until such information is supplied, a substantive ESG analysis of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities for stakeholder groups cannot be completed.",0%,0e5cee8da6d243ed8d4c091a6d8bbff5,How does your organisation recognise and reward employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?,How does your organisation recognise and reward employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ DE&I?,"LGBT Great Feedback-- 73bit\sweta /dThu, 23 Jan 2025 08:17:47 GMT|","It looks like your response repeats the question.

Additionally, leadership openly commends allies and advocates, fostering a culture where support for LGBTQ+ DE&I is valued and encouraged.""

Based on the response provided, there is **no specific information** about how the organisation recognises or rewards employees for their efforts in supporting LGBTQ+ diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). The answer simply repeats the question and does not describe any policies, programmes, or practices.

### 1. Stated Practices
- **None described.**  
  The response does not mention:
  - Formal awards or recognition programmes.
  - Integration of LGBTQ+ DE&I contributions into performance reviews.
  - Financial incentives, bonuses, or promotions linked to DE&I work.
  - Public acknowledgement (e.g., internal communications, events, spotlights).
  - Non-monetary rewards (e.g., development opportunities, leadership roles in ERGs).

### 2. Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities
From the lack of detail, it is not possible to conclude:
- Whether employees are **expected or encouraged** to contribute to LGBTQ+ DE&I.
- Whether there is any **structured mechanism** to recognise:
  - Participation in LGBTQ+ employee resource groups (ERGs).
  - Allyship activities (e.g., training, mentoring, advocacy).
  - Leadership in LGBTQ+ inclusion initiatives or events.
- Whether LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts are **embedded in organisational culture** or remain informal and unrecognised.

### 3. Gaps and Areas Needing Clarification
To assess the organisation’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and maturity, the following information would be needed:
- **Formal policies or frameworks** for recognising DE&I contributions.
- **Types of recognition** (monetary, career-related, symbolic, public recognition).
- **Eligibility and criteria** for recognition (e.g., measurable impact, leadership, participation).
- **Consistency and transparency** of recognition across departments and regions.
- **Examples or case studies** of employees or teams who have been recognised for LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts.

---

## Context of the Response

- **Question:** “If yes, please specify how.”
- **Employee Response:** “9.1 If yes, please specify how.”

This appears to be a placeholder or a reference to a survey item (e.g., “Question 9.1”) rather than a substantive description of how LGBTQ+ DE&I is supported. There is no explicit detail on actions, policies, or practices.

Because the response contains no concrete content about practices, the following outlines what *should* typically be captured under “how” in the context of LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities, and what is *missing* here.

---

## Key LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibility Areas That Should Be Specified

### 1. Policies and Governance

**What should be described:**
- Explicit non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies including sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
- Clear reporting and grievance mechanisms for LGBTQ+-related incidents.
- Governance structures (e.g., DE&I council, LGBTQ+ steering committee) responsible for monitoring progress.

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No mention of any formal policies or who is accountable for enforcing them.

---

### 2. Inclusive Benefits and HR Practices

**What should be described:**
- Equal benefits for same-sex partners and spouses.
- Coverage for gender-affirming healthcare.
- Inclusive parental leave, adoption policies, and family recognition.
- Processes respecting chosen names and pronouns in HR systems and workplace records.

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No detail on whether benefits or HR systems recognize and support LGBTQ+ employees.

---

### 3. Workplace Culture and Training

**What should be described:**
- Mandatory DE&I and anti-bias training that explicitly covers LGBTQ+ inclusion.
- Guidelines for inclusive language and behavior.
- Visible support from leadership (e.g., communications, events, zero-tolerance stance on discrimination).

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No description of training, awareness initiatives, or leadership engagement.

---

### 4. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and Support Structures

**What should be described:**
- Existence and role of LGBTQ+ employee resource groups or affinity networks.
- Mentoring, peer support, or safe-space forums for LGBTQ+ staff.
- Budget and institutional support for LGBTQ+ initiatives and events.

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No indication of ERGs, informal networks, or structured support mechanisms.

---

### 5. Recruitment, Development, and Promotion

**What should be described:**
- Inclusive recruitment practices (e.g., neutral job descriptions, outreach to LGBTQ+ communities).
- Monitoring of representation and promotion rates for LGBTQ+ employees (where lawful and consensual).
- Leadership development opportunities and sponsorship for LGBTQ+ talent.

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No information on whether hiring, evaluation, or promotion processes are designed with LGBTQ+ inclusion in mind.

---

### 6. Data, Measurement, and Transparency

**What should be described:**
- Whether voluntary self-identification for LGBTQ+ status is offered (where legal and safe).
- How inclusion is measured (e.g., engagement surveys, climate assessments).
- Public reporting or internal dashboards tracking LGBTQ+ inclusion initiatives and outcomes.

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No data practices, metrics, or evidence of monitoring are mentioned.

---

### 7. External Engagement and Advocacy

**What should be described:**
- Participation in external LGBTQ+ benchmarks or indices.
- Support of LGBTQ+ community organizations, events, or advocacy.
- Stance on public policy affecting LGBTQ+ rights (where relevant to the business).

**What’s missing in the response:**
- No reference to external commitments or partnerships.

---

## ESG Assessment Implication

Given that the response is effectively non-substantive (“9.1 If yes, please specify how.”) and does not specify any concrete action, policy, or structure:

- **Evidence level:** Insufficient. There is no verifiable description of how LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities are fulfilled.
- **Data gap:** Additional clarification is required. The respondent should detail specific mechanisms, programs, and policies under the areas listed above.
- **Recommendation:** Request a revised response that:
  - Names specific policies and programs.
  - Identifies responsible roles or bodies.
  - Provides examples (e.g., trainings, ERGs, benefits).
  - Where possible, mentions any KPIs or outcomes.

---

In summary, the current employee response does not describe any actual LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities or actions. A complete ESG-aligned answer would need to articulate policies, practices, structures, and metrics across the key areas outlined above.",0%,3e632f5b929d46c2aadf3c89df0a0b98,"For each of the selected options in Q3, please describe how your LGBTQ+ DE&I strategy addresses each option.",LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:,"LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:-- 73bit\sweta /dThu, 23 Jan 2025 08:19:09 GMT|",08fce9eabb7f446e9bc396b56a177aad,"If yes, please provide details of the process and which stakeholder is accountable for it?

*(based on the employee’s response)*

The response provided – “LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box” – does **not** describe any concrete LGBTQ+ DE&I process or clarify who is accountable for it. As written, it appears to be:

- A reference to **LGBT Great** (likely the external LGBTQ+ inclusion specialist/benchmarking body), and  
- A **prompt for additional comments or feedback**, rather than an answer detailing internal processes, roles, or accountabilities.

Because of this, the following elements are **not specified** in the response:

1. **Process description**  
   - No explanation of how LGBTQ+ DE&I is embedded in policies, recruitment, promotion, training, or employee support.  
   - No detail on any formal feedback loops, reporting channels, or escalation mechanisms.  
   - No information on how LGBT Great is used (e.g., benchmarking, training, consultancy, certification).

2. **Stakeholder accountability**  
   - No indication of which internal stakeholder “owns” LGBTQ+ DE&I (e.g., HR/People team, Chief Diversity Officer, ESG lead, Executive Sponsor for LGBTQ+ inclusion, Employee Resource Group leads, etc.).  
   - No mention of governance structures (e.g., DE&I steering committee, working groups) or reporting lines to senior leadership or the board.

3. **Permissions / named individuals**  
   - No individual person is named; therefore:
     - No permission is cited or required for use of a personal name.
     - Accountability is described at neither the individual nor departmental level.

---

### ESG / DE&I Interpretation

From an ESG analysis standpoint, the response suggests:

- **Intent but not evidence**: There is an indication that LGBT Great may be involved or relevant, but no demonstrable process, policy, or governance is described.  
- **Insufficient disclosure**: The information is not adequate to assess:
  - How LGBTQ+ inclusion is managed,  
  - Who is responsible, or  
  - How performance is monitored and improved.

---

### Suggested Clarifications (Information Gaps)

To make this response ESG-useful and aligned with good LGBTQ+ DE&I practice, the organization would need to clarify:

1. **What is the process?**  
   - How LGBTQ+ issues are identified, escalated, and addressed.  
   - How feedback from LGBTQ+ employees is collected (e.g., surveys, focus groups, ERGs) and actioned.  
   - Whether LGBT Great is used for benchmarking, training, audits, or certification.

2. **Who is accountable?**  
   - The specific role(s) or function(s) responsible (e.g., “Head of DE&I,” “HR Director,” “LGBTQ+ ERG Chair,” “Executive Sponsor for LGBTQ+ Inclusion”).  
   - How often they report on progress and to whom (e.g., Executive Committee, Board ESG Committee).

3. **Governance & oversight**  
   - Any formal policies (e.g., D&I policy, anti-discrimination policy, transitioning at work guidelines).  
   - Any measurable objectives or KPIs related to LGBTQ+ inclusion.

Based on the employee’s response, the organization’s LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities and practices, as evidenced in this context, can be summarized as follows:

#### 1. Use of LGBT Great Feedback Mechanism
- The organization appears to use “LGBT Great” (an external benchmarking/feedback or assessment framework) as part of its LGBTQ+ inclusion approach.  
- This suggests a commitment to:
  - Measuring LGBTQ+ inclusion.
  - Gathering structured input on LGBTQ+ workplace experience.
  - Aligning with recognized external standards or best practices for LGBTQ+ equality.

#### 2. Employee Voice and Open-Ended Feedback
- Employees are explicitly invited to provide comments in an open text box:  
  - *“Please add your comments in the below box.”*
- This indicates:
  - An avenue for employees to share qualitative feedback on LGBTQ+ inclusion, policies, culture, and lived experience.
  - A recognition that multiple-choice questions alone may not capture the full nuance of LGBTQ+ employees’ perspectives.
  - A responsibility for the organization to listen to and potentially act on narrative feedback.

#### 3. Question Type and Options Available
- From the provided statement, the only clearly identifiable “question” is an open-ended prompt for comments.
- No fixed-choice demographic or identity-related options (e.g., lesbian, gay, bi, trans, non-binary, prefer not to say, etc.) are specified in the response.
- Therefore, the organization’s current responsibilities, as reflected here, focus on:
  - Allowing voluntary, free-form input from employees.
  - Avoiding compulsory disclosure of sexual orientation or gender identity in this particular item.

#### 4. Implicit DE&I Responsibilities
While not explicitly stated, the structure of this feedback point implies the following responsibilities:

- **Respect for confidentiality and safety**  
  - Open-text LGBTQ+ feedback should be handled in a way that protects anonymity and does not expose individual identities without consent.

- **Responsiveness and accountability**  
  - The organization has an implied duty to review, analyze, and respond to themes in LGBT Great feedback.
  - This includes identifying issues (e.g., discrimination, exclusion, policy gaps) and implementing corrective or improvement actions.

- **Continuous improvement in LGBTQ+ inclusion**  
  - By collecting comments, the organization positions itself to:
    - Improve policies and benefits for LGBTQ+ employees.
    - Enhance training, awareness, and inclusive culture.
    - Monitor progress over time using LGBT Great or similar tools.

---

**In summary:**  
The response indicates that the organization uses LGBT Great as a framework to solicit open-ended feedback from employees on LGBTQ+ inclusion. The primary “option” evident from the text is a voluntary, free-text comment box, reflecting responsibilities around listening to employee experiences, preserving confidentiality, and using this feedback to guide continuous improvement in LGBTQ+ DE&I.",90%,2d5e7f604de645d3b5ecc69fda73e48a,"If yes, please specify what questions are asked and what options are available to your employees.",LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:,"LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:-- 73bit\sweta /dThu, 23 Jan 2025 08:20:40 GMT|",fd6dda376f6f459792eb3900f7bf9076,How does your organisation utilise sexual orientation and gender identity diversity data to improve LGBTQ+ DE&I?,LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:,"LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:-- 73bit\sweta /dThu, 23 Jan 2025 08:20:40 GMT|",1c803de936754166af98c835fb6cd5b1,"What campaigns, strategies or approaches has your organisation undertaken to improve comfort around disclosing self-ID DE&I data?",LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:,"LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:-- 73bit\sweta /dThu, 23 Jan 2025 08:20:40 GMT|","It sounds like you're seeking examples or suggestions regarding campaigns, strategies, or approaches to encourage comfort in disclosing self-identified Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) data, particularly related to LGBT+ identities.

Here are some approaches organizations often use to improve comfort around self-disclosure in DE&I data collection:

1. **Confidentiality Assurance:** Clearly communicate how the data will be kept confidential and used solely for DE&I initiatives, helping individuals feel safe in sharing personal information.

2. **Inclusive Language and Options:** Ensure survey questions use inclusive language and provide diverse options beyond binary or limited categories to reflect all identities accurately.

3. **Leadership Advocacy:** Have leaders openly discuss the importance of self-ID data and model transparency, signaling organizational commitment.

4. **Anonymous Feedback Channels:** Provide opportunities for anonymous feedback or data submission to reduce fear of identification.

5. **Educational Campaigns:** Run awareness campaigns explaining why self-ID data matters, how it benefits employees, and how it drives positive change.

6. **Employee Resource Groups (ERGs):** Engage ERGs to promote participation and foster peer support around disclosure.

7. **Safe Spaces:** Create spaces and forums where employees can share experiences around identity and inclusion safely, potentially increasing comfort in disclosure.

If you want, I can help you draft a more tailored response based on your organization’s specific context or share sample messaging for LGBT+ self-ID data collection campaigns. Would that be helpful?",0%,"### Summary of LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities and Gaps

Based on the response provided, there is **no evidence of defined campaigns, strategies, or approaches** undertaken by the organisation to improve comfort around disclosing self-identification (self‑ID) DE&I data, specifically in relation to LGBTQ+ inclusion.

The answer given – *“LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box”* – appears to be:

- A placeholder or template text, not a description of activity.
- Not indicative of any actual initiatives, policies, or communications.
- Not responsive to the question about what the organisation has done to build trust and comfort in sharing self‑ID data.

---

### Implications for LGBTQ+ DE&I Responsibilities

From an ESG and DE&I perspective, the absence of a substantive response suggests:

1. **Lack of Documented Strategy**
   - No described campaigns (e.g., awareness drives, communications about why data is collected, how it is used, or privacy protections).
   - No reference to leadership messaging on the importance of self‑ID for improving inclusion.

2. **No Clear Evidence of Structural Measures**
   - No mention of:
     - Confidential or anonymous data collection mechanisms.
     - System enhancements (HRIS/self‑service portals) to allow voluntary self‑ID.
     - Data governance measures to protect sensitive LGBTQ+ information.

3. **No Indicated Engagement with LGBTQ+ Employees**
   - No reference to:
     - Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or LGBTQ+ networks.
     - Listening sessions, surveys, or focus groups to understand barriers to self‑ID.
     - Co-creation of policies or campaigns with LGBTQ+ staff.

4. **Transparency and Trust Gaps**
   - The lack of a thoughtful response may reflect:
     - Low maturity in LGBTQ+ data strategy, or
     - Poor internal communication and documentation of existing work, if any exists.
   - This weakens trust in the organisation’s ability to handle sensitive DE&I data responsibly and inclusively.

---

### Recommended Responsibilities / Good Practice (What Should Be in Place)

To meet good-practice LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities around self‑ID data, the organisation should be able to evidence actions such as:

1. **Clear Voluntary Self‑ID Framework**
   - Explicit statement that providing self‑ID data (including sexual orientation and gender identity) is:
     - Voluntary
     - Confidential
     - Used only in aggregate for inclusion and equity purposes.

2. **Communication and Education**
   - Regular campaigns explaining:
     - Why self‑ID data matters (e.g., to identify gaps in representation, pay, progression, wellbeing).
     - How data is stored, accessed, and protected.
   - FAQs, town halls, and internal communications addressing fears about outing or discrimination.

3. **Secure and Inclusive Systems**
   - HR systems that:
     - Enable a range of sexual orientation and gender identity options (beyond binary male/female).
     - Allow employees to update their data easily and discreetly.
   - Data minimisation and role-based access to protect LGBTQ+ employees’ information.

4. **LGBTQ+ Involvement and Governance**
   - Partnership with LGBTQ+ ERGs or advisory groups to:
     - Co-design questions and response options.
     - Test language and ensure it is respectful and inclusive.
   - Oversight by a DE&I committee or similar body that reviews and reports on self‑ID data usage and outcomes.

5. **Assurance Against Misuse**
   - Clear policies prohibiting:
     - Use of self‑ID data in performance, promotion, or disciplinary decisions.
   - Clear escalation channels for concerns or breaches related to DE&I data.

---

### Overall Assessment

At present, the organisation has **not demonstrated any concrete LGBTQ+ DE&I responsibilities or initiatives specific to self‑ID data disclosure** in its response. For a robust ESG/DE&I position, it will need to:

- Develop and implement a coherent self‑ID data strategy.
- Communicate it transparently.
- Engage LGBTQ+ employees in its design.
- Evidence how privacy, trust, and psychological safety are actively protected.",100%,11812840bf184e8ea34a8f7fb9fb5663,How does your organisation target and attract LGBTQ+ talent?,LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:,"LGBT Great Feedback Please add your comments in the below box:-- 73bit\sweta /dThu, 23 Jan 2025 08:22:00 GMT|","Our organisation is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ talent.

**Responsibility:**  
Leverage external expertise to benchmark, improve, and validate LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts.

**How this is (or should be) achieved:**
- Collaborating with organisations such as LGBT Great (or similar) to:
  - Conduct inclusion assessments and benchmarking.
  - Receive structured feedback on policies, culture, and representation.
  - Access training, resources, and best-practice frameworks.
- Using feedback from such partners to:
  - Update policies (e.g., non-discrimination, transitioning at work).
  - Enhance training content on LGBTQ+ topics.
  - Improve communication and visible leadership support for LGBTQ+ inclusion.

## 3. Continuous Improvement Through Feedback

**Responsibility:**  
Treat LGBTQ+ DE&I as an ongoing process informed by employee and external stakeholder input.

**How this is (or should be) achieved:**
- Setting up regular review cycles where feedback (from employees and partners like LGBT Great) is discussed at leadership level.
- Translating feedback into concrete actions, such as:
  - Adjusting recruitment and promotion practices to remove bias.
  - Updating benefits to ensure parity for LGBTQ+ employees and families.
  - Introducing or strengthening LGBTQ+ employee resource groups (ERGs).
- Communicating back to employees what was heard and what has changed in response, closing the feedback loop.

## 4. Clear Communication and Engagement

**Responsibility:**  
Encourage employees to actively participate in shaping LGBTQ+ DE&I efforts.

**How this is (or should be) achieved:**
- Inviting staff to “add comments” or provide open-text feedback (as implied by “Please add your comments in the below box”) during surveys or review exercises.
- Ensuring that:
  - Participation is voluntary and safe.
  - Comments are genuinely reviewed and not symbolic.
  - Outcomes and improvements are shared with staff to demonstrate that feedback matters.
