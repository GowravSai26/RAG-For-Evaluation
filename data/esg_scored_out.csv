Our Talent Acquisition teams work closely with external partners to attract diverse candidates for all roles including work experience and internships. We've also adopted a policy of blind CVs to reduce the risk of bias in our shortlisting and selection processes. Talent Retention In terms of Talent Retention and Learning & Development, we recognise our role as an inclusive employer is about creating opportunities for people to develop and acquire skills. We also recognise that the quality of Line Management across L&G is a key lever for us to improve productivity, inclusion and engagement. We're committed to offering all 1900 of our Line Managers the chance to improve knowledge and skills. Coupled with this programme is a range of focused learning interventions on topics such as inclusive leadership and inclusive management, better decisions, building diverse teams and inclusive ways of working.

DE&I Data Capture / Analysis / KPIs At the heart of our Group-wide D&I approach is the data we ask our people to share. LGBT+ status and gender identity are two key pieces of data we ask employees to share. This data, along with a range of other ""protected characteristics"" is reported and tracked using our Group-wide D&I Dashboards. These dashboards allow us to track representation across the employee lifecycle - attraction, hiring / new joiners, promotions and leavers. We use this data in a number of ways: - our Group D&I Council reviews this data quarterly and invites our Divisional / Functional leadership teams to explain trends in their data - leadership teams receive the data monthly as part of their standard reporting - our Nominations Committee and Board will review extracts of the data on an annual basis to ensure we are delivering against our goals Communications Visibility is an important part of LGBTQ+ inclusion.

Wording: In line with our Inclusion & Diversity Policy, Beazley commits to recruit, retain and develop people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to thrive at all levels of our business, in a truly inclusive environment that operates zero tolerance to discrimination or harassment and fully supports and celebrates differences. This guide is for all managers and colleagues and is designed to provide support and information to assist anyone going through the transitioning process and once they have transitioned. ‘Trans’ is an overarching term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not align comfortably with the sex they were assigned at birth. Transitioning involves the various steps a trans person may take to live in the gender with which they identify. Each person’s experience will be different. For some this involves medical intervention but not all trans people will have this. Transitioning may also involve changing pronouns, telling friends, family or colleagues, dressing differently or changing official documents and we understand that the levels of support an individual may require will vary. If an individual is considering transition, there are a number of things we can do at Beazley to support them. We encourage the individual to speak with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner in the first instance. Confidentiality Trans and non-binary colleagues will take the lead as to whether, when and how they wish to discuss their status. We understand some people may want to keep their gender identity private where others may wish to discuss either in confidence or more openly. We will respect the rights of the individual and great care will be taken not to do anything or share any information that breaches this confidentiality. Any information gathered by Beazley is held securely and only accessed by authorised colleagues with a legitimate need for the information. Absences from work We appreciate individuals may need to be away from work for medical appointments or surgical procedures as well as recovery time. The individual may also wish to work remotely for a period of time while undergoing any procedures. The individual should discuss any planned absences in advance with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner so the appropriate leave policies can be applied or adjustments made. We encourage the line manager and individual to remain in contact during any absences to agree any return to work plans or discuss any further adjustments that may be required. Communication The individual will confirm their details, the date effective and by what pronouns they wish to be addressed in the business moving forwards by discussing with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner. The C&P team will ensure records, directories, email accounts and so on are updated accordingly. The individual and their line manager should discuss how the individual wishes to communicate to others in the team or wider business of their name or pronoun change and agree how this should be done. Should the team or manager require more support, the C&P Business Partner or Inclusion Partner will be able to advise. It will be made clear that any transphobic or discriminatory comments will not be tolerated. Examples of this could be not respecting someone’s pronouns continued use of a trans person’s “deadname” (birth name or name they used prior to transitioning), being subjected to derogatory remarks about their gender identity, being “outed” or excluded as a result of their gender identity. Beazley operates a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination and any examples of transphobic bullying or harassment will be investigated fully. Facilities & Dress Code All colleagues are entitled to use the toilet or changing facilities appropriate to the gender in which they align with, regardless of whether they are currently undergoing or have undergone any gender reassignment. A number of Beazley offices have gender-neutral facilities which are available to use for all colleagues to use too. Beazley have a ‘dress for the day’ gender-neutral policy so individuals are empowered to use their own judgement on what to wear given their working day.

To improve comfort around disclosing self-identified DE&I data, we have implemented several strategies.

Executive Committee: Louise Shield is the Executive Sponsor of the LGBT+ pillar of the D&I Strategy. Progress against the D&I Strategy is reported to the Executive Committee on a 6 monthly basis, and they are collectively responsible for progress against it. The Executive Committee and direct reports have specific objectives set relating to progress against D&I targets. Senior/Non-Exec Management: Fintan Bannon is the Executive Sponsor for the M&G Pride Network. All Senior leaders reporting directly to an Executive Committee member have objectives set relating to progress against the D&I targets. Other Senior Management have responsibility to disseminate and support D&I events and information with their teams. HR Teams have responsibility to ensure all policies are equitable and non-biased, e.g. parental leave policy, which are written to be gender neutral and have seen an increased uptake from LGBT+ parents and families over the preceding years. The HR Team have also actively embedded D&I into their plans (e.g. recruitment, talent management, learning & development) and are responsible for and have performance measured against delivery The Diversity & Inclusion Team have responsibility for delivery against the D&I Strategy and have performance measured against delivery. The Employee Resource Groups continue to partner on intersectionality across all aspects of diversity including LGBT+, an example of which is a recent collaboration with our Pride Network and Mind Matters, our mental health network, exploring eating disorders and how this can impact the LGBT+ Community.","Evidence that well-distributed, articulated and formalised accountabilities that are met with both ambitious targets and the required systems to communicate the impact to wider business.-- LGBTGreat/Lauren /dFri, 02 Aug 2024 10:57:14 GMT|","For the selected stakeholder groups mentioned:

The “how” as well as the “what” is an important part of the performance review process, and underpins the culture at M&G. The “how” and the “what” are culminated in a performance appraisal rating, which influences pay and reward decisions. Employee Resource Group Leaders are expected to include their contributions to the M&G Pride network in their performance planning and year end appraisal conversations with their line managers as part of their performance review discussions. In addition, recognition for those employees who go above and beyond to support an inclusive culture are recognised at M&G’s annual Inclusion Awards, which are hosted and presented by the CEO and members of the Exec Committee. The Award categories are: Role Model of the Year; Rising Star; Network Member of the Year; Inclusion Champion; Wellbeing Champion; Business Impact Champion - a ""People's Choice"" category, where the winner is voted for by colleagues across the whole business. Many of the nominations include colleagues who are being recognised for their work on LGBT+ inclusion and are visible role models in the community. The Awards are celebrated prominently across TAP, our global communication channel. Previous nominees, finalists and winners have included colleagues championing LGBT+ inclusion. Our colleague recognition app, “Say Thanks”, allows colleagues to say thanks to other colleagues for role modelling our behaviours.

Some people also choose to not dress as feminine or masculine and are androgynous. Gender Transition Guide - We do not have a gendered dress code. This means all employees, including trans and non-binary employees can dress as they feel comfortable within the dress code to appear smart and professional. For example, any person of any gender may choose to wear skirts, trousers, make-up, etc.; or a combination thereof.

However, since I don’t have access to the actual attached handbook, this is a generalized response. Please refer to the attached document for the official and specific policy texts.

1. Equal Opportunity Policy  
**Commentary:** This policy ensures that all employees and applicants receive equal treatment regardless of race, gender, age, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics. It fosters a workplace environment that values diversity and inclusion, prohibiting discrimination and promoting fairness in hiring, promotion, and other employment decisions.

2. Sexual Harassment Policy  
**Commentary:** This policy defines sexual harassment and outlines the organization’s commitment to maintaining a workplace free from harassment of any kind. It includes procedures for reporting incidents, investigation protocols, and disciplinary measures to address violations, ensuring employee safety and respect.

3. Non-Discrimination Policy  
**Commentary:** Similar to the Equal Opportunity Policy but often more focused, this policy explicitly prohibits discrimination based on protected classes. It reinforces the organization’s commitment to equal treatment in all aspects of employment and prohibits retaliation against those who report discrimination.

4. Family Care Leave Benefits  
**Commentary:** This policy outlines employee eligibility and procedures for taking leave to care for family members, including parental leave, sick family member leave, or other caregiving responsibilities.

Our DEI strategy is ultimately the responsibility of our Board with LCP’s CEO as executive responsible for DEI outcomes. The strategy is overseen by a DEI Committee which includes LCP’s Head of People, Head of HR, our DEI manager, another senior partner, and a senior representative from each of our four DEI networks. There is no single area of responsibility as it is central to our entire culture and people principles. The LCP Board, with the support of the DEI Committee, regularly reviews our overall DEI strategy, long-term objectives, DEI purpose and vision and supports the Networks, including the LGBTQ+ Network, to articulate their long-term aims and objectives. To support this strategy, the DEI Committee sets overarching areas of focus and success criteria each year with input from the Networks and stakeholders across LCP and each of the four DEI Networks (LGBTQ+, Women’s, Wellbeing, Multicultural) also agree individual success criteria each year. Progress is regularly reviewed by the DEI Committee to reflect on progress over the year and agree next steps. The current overarching aims and long-term objectives for the LGBTQ+ network are below: • Provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for LCPers who identify as LGBTQ+ o Run a series of socials and events o Drive attendance at regular coffee mornings o Work with HR to understand whether LGBTQ+ colleagues are overrepresented in leavers from LCP • Have an influence outside our network by raising awareness, being visible, and supporting our wider community o Increase visibility by posting on Viva Engage o Use events and other means to raise money for our nominated charities, where relevant and appropriate to do so • Promote LCP externally as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer, expanding and deepening LCP’s connections with clients, peers and industry groups. o Build on success of last year’s client event o Continue to support industry groups such as O:Pen, LINK, and TIDE o Build connections with LGBTQ+ individuals as clients and firms who refer us work. Examples of the success criteria against these objectives specific to this year include: • Running at least three socials / events, with at least one to have a trans awareness focus • Work with other networks to deliver intersectional events (eg book or film clubs, or a panel event) • Target average attendance at coffee mornings of 10+ people • A fundraising target of £1,500 for the year plus matching from the LCP Foundation • Target 120+ attendees with similarly positive feedback for an annual client event • Utilise LGBT Great training credit",,"The responsibilities for LGBTQ+ DE&I in your organisation are shared across multiple levels and groups, reflecting an integrated and comprehensive approach:

You clearly explain that performance evaluations during annual appraisals contribute to bonus and pay review decisions, with discretion allowing meaningful efforts in DEI to be financially rewarded. Highlighting that time spent on LGBTQ+ inclusion or broader DEI leadership counts as productive work supports recognition of these contributions. Additionally, mentioning the employee recognition awards with a DEI focus and peer-nomination process emphasizes inclusive acknowledgement of impactful efforts.

To enhance clarity and flow, you might consider slight rephrasing. Here's a polished version of your response:

---

Performance against objectives is assessed during annual appraisals and informs bonus and pay review considerations. Given the discretionary nature of annual bonuses, significant efforts in supporting DEI initiatives, including LGBTQ+ inclusion, can be meaningfully rewarded. Furthermore, time dedicated to LGBTQ+ inclusion activities or wider DEI leadership is regarded as “productive time” when reviewing hours charged at year-end appraisals.

In addition, our employee recognition awards feature a category specifically focused on individuals making a notable impact in DEI and the broader Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) space. Colleagues nominate individuals based on their effort and contributions, with those demonstrating significant achievements receiving formal recognition across the business.

Here are some potential approaches your organisation might consider:

1. **Confidentiality Assurance:** Clearly communicate how personal data is protected and used only in aggregate to help build trust.

2. **Leadership Advocacy:** Have leaders openly discuss and support DE&I initiatives, sharing their own stories if comfortable, to normalize self-ID.

3. **Inclusive Language and Environment:** Use inclusive language in communications and create safe spaces that affirm all identities.

4. **Voluntary and Anonymous Options:** Allow employees to disclose data voluntarily and offer anonymous feedback channels.

5. **Awareness Campaigns:** Run internal campaigns highlighting the importance of self-ID data for shaping inclusive policies and benefits.

6. **Training and Education:** Provide DE&I training to build understanding and reduce stigma around different identities.

7. **Visible ERGs:** Support Employee Resource Groups for LGBT+ employees to foster community and trust.

If you share more about your organisation’s current efforts or culture, I can tailor recommendations further.

Yes, we have seen several positive outcomes from partnering with our LGBT+ suppliers.
