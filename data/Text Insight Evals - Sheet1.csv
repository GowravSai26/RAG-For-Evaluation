Part of our Board's responsibilities are to hold our Group D&I Council to account for defining and implementing our global D&I strategy. Our Group D&I Council is chaired by Laura Mason, CEO, Private Markets and a member of our Group Management Committee. For us D&I goes beyond the traditional focus on “protected characteristics” such as age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and gender identity. While these are very important indicators of what an individual’s perspective might be, we also think that every individual has unique circumstances and our Group D&I Council is accountable for understanding our employees perspectives as well as shaping our D&I agenda. To drive the delivery of our D&I agenda, our Group Head of Inclusion, Group Inclusion Partners and HR teams (Talent Acquisition, Engagement, Policy, Learning ﹠ Development) each play a part in implementing L&G's strategy. Each of our divisional CEOs (and members of our Group Executive Committee) have a proportion of their bonus awarded based on culture. Our annual ""Culture Review"" process is an in-depth assessment of the levels of inclusion across our business, where we look at diversity data, employee feedback and progress made against our stated D&I goals.

On an annual basis, the Board publishes progress against our Group Diversity Policy which covers our commitments on D&I.

Our Group Execs each have 10% of their variable bonus attributed to their performance creating an inclusive culture. Our annual Culture Review process is undertaken as a bottom-up and top-down review of progress around culture, including on our aims to create a diverse workforce and inclusive workplace. - Our group and divisional D&I teams are targeted to deliver against their respective D&I plans as part of our regular performance review process. - As well as the regular performance review process, Line Managers are also assessed using colleague feedback from their teams. The data is captured using our ""Voice"" employee surveys (every 6months). We ask colleagues to provide feedback against a number of issues including inclusion, connection / belonging, speaking out and purposeful leadership. It's also worth acknowledging our view on targets. We want to see regular, progressive improvements in the diversity of our workforce. We won’t be setting outcome targets; instead we track progress against a baselines. This is for a number of reasons: - we recognise that our work to increase the diversity of our workforce and the inclusion of our workplace will never be done - it's a journey of continuous improvement. - It’s also because we have a diverse business. Hove, Cardiff, Chicago, Hong Kong, Singapore and London are very different places, and success will look slightly different for every business we run and every geography we operate in. - We also know that data about our employees is critical if we’re to understand the progress we’re making against our vision: we’ll only know how successful we’ve been when we understand the scale of the challenge we face. - What doesn’t change is our overall vision of a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace.

We promote the events organised by our L&GBT+Allies Network across the group with the support of senior execs and have taken steps in 2024 to focus on the Allyship aspects of the network (e.g. our Allyship Unmasked: Inspiring Stories of Support event in May 2024 held in conjunction with LGBT Great and chaired by Michael Marks, the network’s senior sponsor). Other networks are also keen to partner up with L&GBT in organising family/parenting events (Family and Carers Network) and LGBT+ mental health events (Health&Wellbeing) and also recognise the challenges faced by LGBT+ individuals across the world (Culture Club). All employees have a Culture/D﹠I objective which is measured as part of the annual review process, additionally colleagues who support the LGBT agenda are recognised through the Chairman's awards, opportunities to attend LGBT+ awards, partake in mentoring and leadership development, educational and social events organised by the LGBT committee and funded by the business.",,d0fdb136c95e420db02040d21ba20464,"For each of the selected responses in Q7, please describe what proactive actions have been taken in the last 12 months by individuals and the organisation.","- We encouraged colleagues in leadership positions across multiple locations to participate in the LGBT Great mentoring programme as mentors and mentees, - We continue an approach for Reverse Mentoring in our insurance business with one of the pre-defined issues areas was regarding the LGBT+ experience. - We continue to invest in significant coaching provision of Line Managers and Leaders - designed to help them create inclusive environments in their teams, businesses and divisions. - The network has worked with senior leaders in a reverse mentoring capacity to share their challenges and to educate the leadership teams - Deon Pillay, previously a co-chair of our L&GBT network is now co-chair of The Legal & General Inclusion Team -We also partner with LGBT Great, Trans in the City, Just Like Us and Interinvest to ensure training, development and awareness of LGBT+ issues, language, allyship. - Senior Leaders and network colleagues continue to support other organisations, in their capacity as panellist and key notes: Diversity Project, LGBT Great, InterInvest, Just Like Us, The LGBTQ+ Insurance Network, Involve, and Pride",,b5ccce00e5464a12883f3fd5bad0e179,"If yes, please specify how.",,,3e632f5b929d46c2aadf3c89df0a0b98,"For each of the selected options in Q3, please describe how your LGBTQ+ DE&I strategy addresses each option.","Workforce planning, succession planning & promotion HR and business colleagues have access to our workforce data and use it as part of our Strategic Workforce Planning processes.

Our Talent Acquisition teams work closely with external partners to attract diverse candidates for all roles including work experience and internships. We've also adopted a policy of blind CVs to reduce the risk of bias in our shortlisting and selection processes. Talent Retention In terms of Talent Retention and Learning & Development, we recognise our role as an inclusive employer is about creating opportunities for people to develop and acquire skills. We also recognise that the quality of Line Management across L&G is a key lever for us to improve productivity, inclusion and engagement. We're committed to offering all 1900 of our Line Managers the chance to improve knowledge and skills. Coupled with this programme is a range of focused learning interventions on topics such as inclusive leadership and inclusive management, better decisions, building diverse teams and inclusive ways of working. Learning & Development The L&GBT+ Network has a workstream dedicated to Learning & Development, which focuses on organising events and creating resources and programmes providing education on LGBTQ+ topics. In 2024 this workstream organised a several educational events utilising our relationships with our charity partners, added a number of educational resources to our network hub which can be accessed across the business, and launched a company wide Allyship training programme. Pay, rewards & benefits Staff are rewarded based on their end of year appraisal, objectives are linked to DEI, In addition colleagues championing LGBT+ diversity have received tickets to LGBT awards, enjoy company sponsored social networking and LGBT+ events together with Career development and mentoring opportunities. DE&I Data Capture / Analysis / KPIs At the heart of our Group-wide D&I approach is the data we ask our people to share. LGBT+ status and gender identity are two key pieces of data we ask employees to share. This data, along with a range of other ""protected characteristics"" is reported and tracked using our Group-wide D&I Dashboards. These dashboards allow us to track representation across the employee lifecycle - attraction, hiring / new joiners, promotions and leavers. We use this data in a number of ways: - our Group D&I Council reviews this data quarterly and invites our Divisional / Functional leadership teams to explain trends in their data - leadership teams receive the data monthly as part of their standard reporting - our Nominations Committee and Board will review extracts of the data on an annual basis to ensure we are delivering against our goals Communications Visibility is an important part of LGBTQ+ inclusion. Employee stories and testimonials from LGBTQ+ colleagues are shared both through internal L&G News communications and externally through a variety of channels including our website and LinkedIn.

The training also delves into the meaning and history of Pride, exploring its origins, significance, and evolution over the years. This section provides context on why Pride is celebrated and its ongoing importance in promoting equality and visibility for the LGBT+ community. Additionally, the training keeps employees informed about current news and events related to Pride, ensuring everyone is aware of important developments and initiatives. Finally, it introduces our company's LGBT network, outlining the resources, groups, and support systems available to employees. This network serves as a valuable tool for fostering connection and creating a sense of community within the workplace. In addition to the resources attached we have hosted and made available to L&G employees in-person and virtual events, hosted with partners such as LGBT Great and Interinvest. In June we hosted the Allyship Unmasked event, this inspiring event brought a captivating journey into the heart of allyship, where industry heroes shared their transformative stories of support and solidarity. The event was a collaborative effort with LGBT Great, and we welcomed peers from various financial services companies to convene at our Coleman Street premises for an engaging panel discussion. In August we celebrated South Asian Heritage Month, and held an event with the theme 'Free to Be Me' in collaboration with Interinvest. We were delighted to welcome Laks Mann MBE from the South Asian Heritage Month team. He illustrated how FreeToBeMe enables us to celebrate our backgrounds and the dynamic nature of identity in different contexts and intersectionality. In September we hosted the InterInvest Bi+ Awareness Week panel, in partnership with Just Like Us! The panel was an insightful conversation with Ambassadors from Just Like Us, who will shed light on how the next generation increasingly views sexuality as fluid and on the expectations around bi+** inclusion in the workplace and LGBTQ+ spaces.",,8d8645607efb48299ab7237858e5769c,"If yes, please attach a copy of the policy and provide examples of how you hold your suppliers to account on LGBT+ DE&I.","We hold ourselves and our employees to high standards when it comes to role modelling responsible behaviour as it’s important to us that all our stakeholders can expect us to behave fairly and to do the right thing.

Our suppliers must have processes in place to maintain these standards and be able to provide evidence if required. These processes are scrutinised closely both as part of the procurement process but also as part of the ongoing commercial arrangement. This code of conduct is reviewed and recertified on an annual basis to ensure that are supplier remains compliant with the policy. For key suppliers, Legal & General hold formal quarterly and annual strategic reviews where performance, opportunities and strategic alignment are reviewed. We have published an organisation-wide agenda to make discussions on topics, such as sustainability and corporate social responsibility, a standard practice of working with suppliers. This includes areas such as employee welfare, the living wage as well as diversity and inclusion within the supplier’s business. We encourage collaboration between organisations on issues such as LGBTQ+ and have held joint meetings between employee resource groups to drive progress on shared objectives.

These initiatives aim to celebrate our achievements, reinforce our culture-building goals, and ensure the continuous development of our employees and leaders in DEI-related activities. 1. DEI Awards Program Launch: This year marks the introduction of our DEI Awards, a significant initiative to acknowledge the exceptional contributions of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and individual members who have played a pivotal role in driving specific campaigns, such as LGBTQ+ History Month. This program enables both our CEO and the organization to honour outstanding efforts in advancing our DEI objectives. 2. Integration of ERG Goals in Year-End Reviews: We are requesting ERG Leaders to incorporate their specific DEI targets into their Performance Reviews (PR). This inclusion will ensure that managers consider the achievements in culture-building and DEI objectives as integral components of the overall employee evaluation process. 3. HR Communications to Managers: To reinforce our DEI commitments, HR will periodically issue reminders to managers. These communications are designed to encourage managers to actively support ERG Leads within their teams by promoting their projects and fostering an environment of active allyship across the broader organization. 4. Executive Sponsor Recognition: To further acknowledge the efforts of our ERG Leads, Executive Sponsors will send personalised emails to line managers. These communications will highlight the importance of recognising ERG Lead contributions and ensuring they receive the necessary support to bring our firm’s values to life. 5. LGBT Great Initiative Participation: We continue to nominate employees for external recognition through the LGBT Great initiative, celebrating LGBT+ role models and allies within our firm.

These initiatives represent powerful actions taken to not only foster an inclusive workplace but also to empower our ERG leaders and members with the skills and opportunities they need to excel and drive meaningful change. Innovative Mentoring Programs: At the forefront of our efforts is the development of a comprehensive mentoring program, spearheaded by the Executive Sponsor of our Pride ERG. This program, which includes mentoring, reciprocal mentoring, and reverse mentoring elements, is designed to facilitate a rich exchange of ideas, experiences, and insights among employees. Leveraging resources from LGBT Great, this initiative aims to launch in 2025, setting a new benchmark for leadership development and inclusion within our firm. Elevated Internal Training and Coaching: Recognising the pivotal role of continuous learning, we have institutionalised bi-annual refresher training for our ERG Leads. This initiative is tailored to ensure that our leaders remain at the cutting edge of DE&I practices, leadership strategies, and the management of dynamic and effective ERGs. External Training and Leadership Development: To further our commitment to nurturing our leaders, we are placing our ERG Leads on esteemed talent programs designed to enhance their leadership capabilities. This external coaching and training initiative is aimed at equipping our leaders with the skills necessary to inspire, guide, and make an impactful difference both within and outside our organization. Access to LGBTQ+ Focused Conferences and Events: We are providing our ERGs with unparalleled access to leading LGBTQ+ focused conferences and events, such as D&I Leaders.

Wording: In line with our Inclusion & Diversity Policy, Beazley commits to recruit, retain and develop people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to thrive at all levels of our business, in a truly inclusive environment that operates zero tolerance to discrimination or harassment and fully supports and celebrates differences. This guide is for all managers and colleagues and is designed to provide support and information to assist anyone going through the transitioning process and once they have transitioned. ‘Trans’ is an overarching term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not align comfortably with the sex they were assigned at birth. Transitioning involves the various steps a trans person may take to live in the gender with which they identify. Each person’s experience will be different. For some this involves medical intervention but not all trans people will have this. Transitioning may also involve changing pronouns, telling friends, family or colleagues, dressing differently or changing official documents and we understand that the levels of support an individual may require will vary. If an individual is considering transition, there are a number of things we can do at Beazley to support them. We encourage the individual to speak with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner in the first instance. Confidentiality Trans and non-binary colleagues will take the lead as to whether, when and how they wish to discuss their status. We understand some people may want to keep their gender identity private where others may wish to discuss either in confidence or more openly. We will respect the rights of the individual and great care will be taken not to do anything or share any information that breaches this confidentiality. Any information gathered by Beazley is held securely and only accessed by authorised colleagues with a legitimate need for the information. Absences from work We appreciate individuals may need to be away from work for medical appointments or surgical procedures as well as recovery time. The individual may also wish to work remotely for a period of time while undergoing any procedures. The individual should discuss any planned absences in advance with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner so the appropriate leave policies can be applied or adjustments made. We encourage the line manager and individual to remain in contact during any absences to agree any return to work plans or discuss any further adjustments that may be required. Communication The individual will confirm their details, the date effective and by what pronouns they wish to be addressed in the business moving forwards by discussing with their line manager and/or relevant C&P Business Partner. The C&P team will ensure records, directories, email accounts and so on are updated accordingly. The individual and their line manager should discuss how the individual wishes to communicate to others in the team or wider business of their name or pronoun change and agree how this should be done. Should the team or manager require more support, the C&P Business Partner or Inclusion Partner will be able to advise. It will be made clear that any transphobic or discriminatory comments will not be tolerated. Examples of this could be not respecting someone’s pronouns continued use of a trans person’s “deadname” (birth name or name they used prior to transitioning), being subjected to derogatory remarks about their gender identity, being “outed” or excluded as a result of their gender identity. Beazley operates a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination and any examples of transphobic bullying or harassment will be investigated fully. Facilities & Dress Code All colleagues are entitled to use the toilet or changing facilities appropriate to the gender in which they align with, regardless of whether they are currently undergoing or have undergone any gender reassignment. A number of Beazley offices have gender-neutral facilities which are available to use for all colleagues to use too. Beazley have a ‘dress for the day’ gender-neutral policy so individuals are empowered to use their own judgement on what to wear given their working day. If you have any questions about this document, the support available or would like to discuss further, either as someone considering or undergoing their transition or supporting another individual, please contact your C&P Business Partner Inclusive parental leave policy (i.e. shared maternity & parental leave) - policy screenshot attached.

The Board provides challenge and feedback on progress, holding the Executive Committee to account on progress against the strategy. All colleagues are invited to take part in our employee engagement survey, and a sub-set of the survey forms the Inclusion Index. The overall responsibility and accountability for year-on-year improvement is held at the Board and Exec Committee level. In addition, each Exec Committee member is held accountable for improvement in their respective Inclusion Index score within their area of responsibility. The M&G inclusion index is cascaded from Exec Management to each people manager with a team of more than 10 people to be able to track year on year improvement of colleague inclusion within their respective teams. The inclusion index is analysed across many aspects of diversity including LGBT+ to ensure there is no significant difference in treatment of the feeling of inclusion of colleagues. If a difference is identified, then those individual teams/managers work with HR to put a plan in place focusing on improving inclusion based on the feedback provided by colleagues. Executive Committee: Louise Shield is the Executive Sponsor of the LGBT+ pillar of the D&I Strategy. Progress against the D&I Strategy is reported to the Executive Committee on a 6 monthly basis, and they are collectively responsible for progress against it. The Executive Committee and direct reports have specific objectives set relating to progress against D&I targets. Senior/Non-Exec Management: Fintan Bannon is the Executive Sponsor for the M&G Pride Network. All Senior leaders reporting directly to an Executive Committee member have objectives set relating to progress against the D&I targets. Other Senior Management have responsibility to disseminate and support D&I events and information with their teams. HR Teams have responsibility to ensure all policies are equitable and non-biased, e.g. parental leave policy, which are written to be gender neutral and have seen an increased uptake from LGBT+ parents and families over the preceding years. The HR Team have also actively embedded D&I into their plans (e.g. recruitment, talent management, learning & development) and are responsible for and have performance measured against delivery The Diversity & Inclusion Team have responsibility for delivery against the D&I Strategy and have performance measured against delivery.

We do all of this in a safe, trusting and inclusive environment where colleagues can speak up if something is wrong and feel able to challenge, knowing appropriate action will be taken. The “how” as well as the “what” is an important part of the performance review process, and underpins the culture at M&G. The “how” and the “what” are culminated in a performance appraisal rating, which influences pay and reward decisions. Employee Resource Group Leaders are expected to include their contributions to the M&G Pride network in their performance planning and year end appraisal conversations with their line managers as part of their performance review discussions. In addition, recognition for those employees who go above and beyond to support an inclusive culture are recognised at M&G’s annual Inclusion Awards, which are hosted and presented by the CEO and members of the Exec Committee. The Award categories are: Role Model of the Year; Rising Star; Network Member of the Year; Inclusion Champion; Wellbeing Champion; Business Impact Champion - a ""People's Choice"" category, where the winner is voted for by colleagues across the whole business. Many of the nominations include colleagues who are being recognised for their work on LGBT+ inclusion and are visible role models in the community. The Awards are celebrated prominently across TAP, our global communication channel. Previous nominees, finalists and winners have included colleagues championing LGBT+ inclusion. Our colleague recognition app, “Say Thanks”, allows colleagues to say thanks to other colleagues for role modelling our behaviours.

And if you’re already a parent, there are other types of family leave available too.

The board is also involved in implementing inclusion strategies through the Moody's Diversity Council, which consists of senior leaders. This council ensures that strategic priorities are actualized with checks and balances instituted by a global executive council and regional councils in EMEA. Moreover, the board's involvement extends to supporting significant milestones such as earning a 100% from the Human Rights Campaign on its Corporate Equality Index since 2013 and being recognized as a top employer for LGBTQ+ people The Executive Leadership Team and senior leaders are involved in setting and agreeing on the LGBTQ+ inclusion strategy yearly through the strategic planning process. They are expected to demonstrate how they have increased inclusion in their teams as part of their performance management. The People Team and the Inclusion Team develop, govern, and execute the Inclusion strategy for Moody's in partnership with BRGs, leadership, Global and Regional Executive Sponsors, and every Moody's employee.

For instance, one of the objectives is to ensure that 85% of open positions will have a diverse slate of candidates for the first round of interviews. This is a new measure introduced to track the progress of inclusion in the hiring process. The scorecard also includes measures for the success and growth of women, empowering Business Resource Groups (BRGs) to champion the culture of inclusion, and the implementation of inclusive benefits like the Global, Gender-Neutral Parental Leave policy. The Inclusion Scorecard is connected to individual and team objectives through Moody's Grow, Perform, Succeed (GPS) objective-setting and development planning performance management approach. Employees are encouraged to work with their manager to connect their individual and team objectives to the company's strategic and operational objectives outlined on the Corporate Scorecard. The TIDE programme (Talent, Inclusion, Diversity, and Equality) likely contributes to the Inclusion Scorecard by supporting the company's commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. The specific goals and objectives of the TIDE programme would align with the broader DE&I strategy and be reviewed annually to measure progress.

The policy includes harassment on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and the status of being transgender. Discrimination Based on Gender Identity and Expression Policy: The same policy also covers discrimination and harassment based on gender identity and expression. It ensures a work environment that respects the dignity and worth of each individual and is free from all forms of employment discrimination. Transitioning at Work Policy: Moody's Gender Transition Guidelines support employees considering transitioning in the workplace. The guidelines affirm the right of employees to express their gender identity and characteristics without fear of negative consequences and recommend working closely with the People Team and management to ensure the best possible transition experience. Support for Non-Binary Employees at Work Policy: Non-binary employees are supported in expressing their gender identity and characteristics at work.

This sponsor plays a pivotal role in securing support from the Executive Committee and senior management, helping to foster a company-wide culture of inclusivity. They act as a role model for being an ally and championing inclusive behaviours. They help to raise the profile of the employee networks and get buy in and support from the rest of the executive committee as needed. Non-Executive Management The driving forces from within this stakeholder group are the I&D committee, co-chaired by Ben Bramhall, our co-CEO, and Charlotte West, Head of Employee Engagement. This committee is tasked with shaping our overarching I&D strategy and overseeing its implementation. Formed of representatives from across our business functions and the network chairs, the committee draws on a wide range of perspectives to manage a comprehensive I&D programme. This programme addresses inclusion related to gender, ethnicity, disability and LGBTQ+ communities, alongside mental health and wellbeing. The I&D committee holds our employee networks accountable for achieving their strategic objectives and bi-annually reports their progress to the plc Board. Human Resources + D&I HR is responsible for facilitating the implementation of key initiatives, particularly around policies and process. Working in tandem with the networks, HR reviews these annually to ensure continuous improvement in fostering a fully inclusive environment. As part of our organisational structure, the D&I function falls within scope of the Employee Engagement Team which reports up to the HR Director. The team supports the employee networks, lends expertise on maximising the effectiveness of resource groups, orchestrates events and educational activities, and facilitates cross-functional collaboration for business-wide change. They set the standard for inclusive behaviour and work to maintain the visibility and buy-in of our DEI agenda through consistent communication and internal networking. Collaboration between HR and the Employee Engagement team is also key in delivering inclusion training to all line managers and new colleagues. Network Chairs The chairs of our Employee Networks (employee resource groups) are responsible for working with the wider network and business to establish a strategy for the year which identifies: • Priorities - key focus areas for the year • Objectives • Actions to achieve the defined objectives • Appropriate KPIs With the support of the EE Team, the Network chairs ensure the strategy is delivered across the year.

There is a specific objective on Inclusion and Diversity which aims to create a holistically inclusive environment rather than targeting any group or category. The objective is worded as follows: “Everyone has the responsibility of making XPS a great place to work. We all have responsibility for actively promoting equality of opportunity, acting in line with our values and providing colleagues with the opportunity to share their ideas, views, and concerns.” The Employee Engagement Team Each network has a dedicated Employee Engagement Team lead. The Employee Engagement Team member then has specific objectives aligned to the delivery of key actions relating to the delivery of the network strategies they are linked to. Employee Resource Groups The employee resource groups are assessed annually by the I&D committee on what they have delivered over the year. With published strategies, action plans and KPIs for the year, these are used to track their impact. Performance by the networks then influence the budgets available to them in future years. Network chairs and members may also have individual objectives aligned to their contributions to these networks that they have agreed with their line managers.

Our DEI strategy is ultimately the responsibility of our Board with LCP’s CEO as executive responsible for DEI outcomes. The strategy is overseen by a DEI Committee which includes LCP’s Head of People, Head of HR, our DEI manager, another senior partner, and a senior representative from each of our four DEI networks. There is no single area of responsibility as it is central to our entire culture and people principles. The LCP Board, with the support of the DEI Committee, regularly reviews our overall DEI strategy, long-term objectives, DEI purpose and vision and supports the Networks, including the LGBTQ+ Network, to articulate their long-term aims and objectives. To support this strategy, the DEI Committee sets overarching areas of focus and success criteria each year with input from the Networks and stakeholders across LCP and each of the four DEI Networks (LGBTQ+, Women’s, Wellbeing, Multicultural) also agree individual success criteria each year. Progress is regularly reviewed by the DEI Committee to reflect on progress over the year and agree next steps. The current overarching aims and long-term objectives for the LGBTQ+ network are below: • Provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for LCPers who identify as LGBTQ+ o Run a series of socials and events o Drive attendance at regular coffee mornings o Work with HR to understand whether LGBTQ+ colleagues are overrepresented in leavers from LCP • Have an influence outside our network by raising awareness, being visible, and supporting our wider community o Increase visibility by posting on Viva Engage o Use events and other means to raise money for our nominated charities, where relevant and appropriate to do so • Promote LCP externally as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer, expanding and deepening LCP’s connections with clients, peers and industry groups. o Build on success of last year’s client event o Continue to support industry groups such as O:Pen, LINK, and TIDE o Build connections with LGBTQ+ individuals as clients and firms who refer us work. Examples of the success criteria against these objectives specific to this year include: • Running at least three socials / events, with at least one to have a trans awareness focus • Work with other networks to deliver intersectional events (eg book or film clubs, or a panel event) • Target average attendance at coffee mornings of 10+ people • A fundraising target of £1,500 for the year plus matching from the LCP Foundation • Target 120+ attendees with similarly positive feedback for an annual client event • Utilise LGBT Great training credit",,35cc2d603789460ca6a7860e603cf021,"For each of the selected stakeholder groups in Q3, please describe who they are and how they are measured against LGBTQ+ DE&I goals and objectives.
